![Taylor J. Meek : Lingnik]({{ site.url }}/assets/taylor-meek.jpg)

I believe in using technology, through the application of sound software
engineering practices, to solve problems. *Software Engineer* puts too much
emphasis on the tool that I use, and not the thing that I do. Those things I am
most passionate about mirror my work and education: stewardship for the
environment and more effective human collaboration.

At CloudBolt Software, I help enterprise teams leverage cloud computing
resources and their existing servers faster and better by leading the product
development team and contributing core code myself. I previously worked in the
renewable energy space as a lead EMS-SCADA developer, facilitating the
efficient delivery of wind and hydroelectric power.

The studies I took on at Portland State gave me a primer in Linguistics and
deepened my fascination of using technology to help people communicate better.

I sometimes teach Python and Django classes and alongside my (arborist) wife,
my volunteer hat includes being a crew leader for Friends of Trees, where we
help make our city a greener and greater place to live. We share a small home
in inner southeast Portland where our family raises chickens and a duck for
eggs and tends a garden for produce -- and love living in a diverse city with
things to do.
