![Taylor J. Meek : Lingnik]({{ site.url }}/assets/taylor-sepia-350x350.png)

I believe in using technology, through the application of sound software engineering practices, to solve problems. I could say that I'm a software engineer, but that puts too much emphasis on the tool that I use, and not the thing that I do. The few things I am most passionate about mirror my work and education -- stewardship for the environment and more effective human collaboration.

At Iberdrola Renewables, I help to make industrial-scale wind and solar power an efficient and reliable means to power our planet by working alongside a team of skilled real-time EMS/SCADA engineers and analysts. The studies I took on at Portland State gave me a primer in Linguistics, and deepened my fascination of using technology to help people communicate better. Alongside my (arborist) wife, my volunteer hat is that of a crew leader for Friends of Trees, where we help make our city a greener and greater place to live. We share a small home in Inner Southeast Portland where our family raises chickens for eggs and tends a garden for produce -- and love living in a diverse city with things to do.
