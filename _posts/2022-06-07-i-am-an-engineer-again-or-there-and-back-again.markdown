## Part One: The Email
I wrote an email to the folks I work with at work recently. It went something like this.

**Subject:** I‚Äôm an Engineer Again: Or, There and Back Again  
**Date:** June 7, 2022  
**From:** Taylor Meek  
**To:** we probably worked together at one point and you should know about my career pivot

Hi!

I decided to stop being a manager (for now). This was my choice, no-one else‚Äôs, and I was not pressured into it. (No gossip or rumors, k? Feel free to share this email as needed.) I‚Äôm staying at Heroku because I love it here, and I‚Äôm excited about our next chapter together. I kinda want to write a love letter to Heroku. Or maybe‚Ä¶

The gist is, $big_scary_incident reminded me how much I love troubleshooting, research+writing work, and writing code. That was pretty sweet. So, I‚Äôm pivoting over to being an engineer effective today. Wanna know more? I wrote a little essay <here> about my career journey from Engineer to Manager and Back Again. I think I‚Äôm serious about the blog thing, if I can find the time. We'll see.

Now that Really Awesome Staff Engineer is officially a Director (üéâ), I‚Äôll be reporting to her for my next chapter, and working with her to draft a strategic plan for my next couple quarters‚Äô work. It will take a bit for the org chart to update, but my old boss‚Äô email to the team explains the rest.

Cheers and üíús,  
Taylor


## Part Two: The Narrative
üëã Hi again. So, now you know I‚Äôm leaving management and going back to being an individual contributor. Did you know I used to be an engineer? Twelve years slinging code and hand-carving infra. But then something happened that led me to management‚Ä¶ it went something like this:

#### I used to be an engineer.
Eight years ago this past April, I‚Äôm at some renewable energy company. EMS/SCADA systems, some time-series databases. Just finished Giant Compliance Automation Project and Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Project From Hell (won the ‚ÄúD.R. Prepper‚Äù award for that) and üòÖ I need a break from that. Free cycles and a successful run gives me the street cred to go off and solve a problem that has been bouncing around in my head for a while. I spike out a proof of concept: $automate_thing. Pitch $automate_more_things to The People In Charge. Use all my Engineer Jedi Mind Tricks but fail my persuasion check. Headcount can‚Äôt magically appear, and there‚Äôs resistance. Lots of resistance. Bummer, but‚Ä¶

hey! üí° These people with the Manager title seem to get their way. (And they get paid more![^1]) I should go be one of them.

That‚Äôs when I decided to leave engineering and ops to pivot to management. Not right away. Went to some conference talk on being a Lead and they‚Äôre talking about this Michael Lopp (rands) guy and this Rands Leadership Slack community that‚Äôs a great place to learn from others about managing (coughLEADINGcough ‚Äî I was naive) humans. Oh, and he wrote the book. (Managing Humans, I mean.) So I give that a read. Practiced this Lead thing for a while longer, mentored and organized bigger projects and Got Shit Done.


#### Then there were those years where I was a manager.

February, 2015. Interview at a startup‚Ä¶ BOOM. Lead, Manager within the first month, took three years to grow a team from three engineers to 15. Startup, though, remember? So I‚Äôm coding a lot in the beginning, or writing design specs. Teaching the architecture to the New Guard as I hire them. Over time, I have more people to lead. Less time to code. Still the same pressure to code, to deliver. Why don‚Äôt I just start my own startup at the same time? No problem, I can handle it. Oh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ wife and I are having twins. Wait, how many hours am I working every week? Is this what burnout feels like?

October, 2018. Interview at Heroku. Data Team, Engineering Manager. I. Am. Excited. Interview with nice-human-who-was-going-to-be-my-boss-but-got-promoted-during-the-interview-process, then some other wonderful folks who aren‚Äôt at Heroku anymore and I dearly miss working with, and lastly a wonderful conversation about leading humans with a future peer manager. They didn‚Äôt want a manager that codes. They wanted a human who can help other humans thrive, get some projects going full-speed.

Along the way, I learned a ton. Met a lot of really fascinating humans. Helped many of them accomplish cool things. Advised some of them towards accomplishing really awesome career goals. Got exposed to parts of The Business‚Ñ¢ that I never would have seen otherwise. This foreign-to-me career pivot has been one of the best and hardest chapters of my career.


#### What went sideways?

It's 2022 now. What a... something... few years we've all been going through, huh?

So why am I pivoting back to engineering? Well‚Ä¶ it turns out, Managers don‚Äôt actually have the power they think they do. I‚Äôm going to tell you a secret. When I got this job, I ‚Äúfound‚Äù this magic wand laying around. I can make people do anything with it! Projects just happen. People do things I ask. I can grease that squeaky bureaucratic wheel with it. With it, I was able to use it to do some really awesome things. Mostly for good. Some mistakes along the way, of course. Only a few singed eyebrows.

But the real power of that wand manifested when I started giving it away to others around me. First it was my directs. Engineers who worked for me‚Äîat first just the battle-scarred ones‚Äîwho I trusted to lead a thing. Then things got spicy at work and I **had** to give up even more‚Ä¶ so I started giving the wand to people who I didn‚Äôt necessarily know if they‚Äôd succeed or not.

When they succeeded, it was marvelous! When they failed‚Ä¶ they learned. They did better the next time. Huh. Didn‚Äôt see that coming, for some reason. See, the battle-scarred engineers only got those scars from using the wand the wrong way in the past, or from making mistakes. Those scars stuck with them and became lasting memories of that time I plugged in an errant network cable and we lost control of four gigawatts of wind turbines. I was lucky enough to stumble into teams that were supportive and nurturing of the folks who made such mistakes. Not everyone has been so lucky.


#### What do you do when you give away all your magic wands?

At some point, the work got‚Ä¶ dull. My vision and strategy for the team was underway. We had some projects, some roadmaps, and lots of interesting things to go work on. I watched as engineers got to thrive in the work of design docs, PRs, mentoring each other, and working with our customers. And‚Ä¶ I got a bit jealous. In giving everything interesting away, I had left only the dull work for myself: the expense reports, the offsite planning, the talent reviews and promotion packets, the continuous cycle of check-ins and planning.

All very important work, but not work that sparked joy in me. The work felt grueling sometimes, and stressful, and I had to work with a psychiatrist, a BetterUp coach, and an executive mindfulness coach to process all the myriad reactions I was having about work. I knew I needed a change again, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what yet. I had known since November. I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted. It took me a looooong time to process all of the above.

Then in April, in the midst of The Incident That Will Not Be Named, I had an insight that I was enjoying my work again, despite the hardship of a fully unreasonable (self-induced) work schedule. So, I decided to exit management. I do want to keep leading people, but I want to lead as an engineer instead of a manager. I‚Äôm excited about what‚Äôs next, but that‚Äôs a topic for another blog[^2].


#### My hypothesis: I‚Äôm going to be a better engineer because of this journey.

Here‚Äôs the second moral of the story. (The first is the magic wand mindset, which is actually a story about delegation, the constant search for personal growth, and shifting towards an Infinite Game mindset.)

See: I had left engineering to be a manager because I had the (mistaken) impression that only managers could get $thing_you_are_excited_about prioritized in an organization. **It turns out that‚Äôs actually called influence and leadership, and you don‚Äôt have to pursue being a manager to learn and practice those skills.** Also: the job of a manager is wayyyyyyy different than I expected[^3].

Whoops.

But through that journey, I now have deep empathy for my boss‚Äôs predicaments. I know the challenges she faces every day because I‚Äôve lived them. I know how it impacts her when I don‚Äôt communicate my status, when I don‚Äôt ask my teams enough questions to understand what‚Äôs going on with the projects they‚Äôre leading, when I half-ass my Staff engineer‚Äôs promo pitch, when I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and don‚Äôt say anything about it. As an early-career engineer, these things managers do irked me. They led to me leaving an engineering role.

All these scars I got while managing the best humans I‚Äôve ever worked with? Those scars are teachers, and I‚Äôm optimistic that I can not only apply them myself (or learn to‚Äîafter screwing up some more), but can also model them for the team that now sits next to me.  

<br />

In retrospect, would I have chosen to be a manager again? Yeah. Totally would. I'm a better leader for it. Maybe a better engineer? We'll see about that. But management is not for everyone, and our industry has got to find a way for that to be OK.  


[^1]: Not all companies. Companies that optimize for the Engineer>Manager transition as the only path to making more money or working on more complex things are, IMHO, either lower-margin companies who can't justify paying ICs more based on their business model or ‚Ä¶ are doing it wrong. Or both. Don't make people take a job they don't want as the sole means of career growth.

[^3]: Not all in a bad way! There were some genuinely beautiful moments of the gig, and a lot of good things happened for our team and for our customers as a result of the work I got to lead.
