=================

This is my jekyll repository. (https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
The jekyll branch holds the code I use to generate the page, as
well as the raw content for the website itself. All of my pages
are written in markdown. The master branch contains the site as
jekyll generates it.

The website is hosted at http://lingnik.com/ -- load balancing
is provided by CloudFlare, and hosting is via GitHub Sites.
