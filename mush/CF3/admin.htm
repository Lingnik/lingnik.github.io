  <p><h1><tt>Administration of CF3</tt></h1></p>
  <p><h3><tt>Vauki</tt></h3></p>
  <blockquote>
    Vauki was here with the MUSH was created originally, back whenever or
something. At that time, it was just a little MUCK known only as as Cyber
Fur, with a few regular players and whatnot. With the help of a small
staff of wizards, he managed to spur the little place right along until it
had a small regular playerbase. When the site eventually upgraded its
operating system, MUCK quickly became buggy and unusable. With that, the
decision was made to move to MUSH, which was known to work on the server
decently. With that, Cyber Fur 2 was spawned, with a new timeline. As
that, too, failed due to theme and timeline issues, Cyber Fur 3 came into
existance working along a similar timeline to the original.
 Today, he works alongsize his tightly knit group of admin, tinkering with
code, the server, and other various things that make the MUSH work. Giving
ludicrous orders to Khirsah for insane ideas of building, he still retains
his superiority over everyone. Because you suck. Honest.

  <p><h3><tt>Khirsah</tt></h3></p>
  <blockquote>
 Showing up near the Beginning - back when there was merely a little MUCK
called Cyber Fur, Khirsah joined up with Vauki and assumed his job as the
Building Wizard. Somewhere not too long after, he became the
second-in-command of the place, and created the world where the MUCK took
place. Unfortunately, between a buggy server, Wizards falling out of
existence, and theme problems, Cyber Fur was placed in data storage, and a
far-future version - CyberFur 2 - took it's place as a MUSH. Here, Khirsah
created a full galaxy, crafting worlds and starships. Sadly, the MUSH was
shut down due to timeline and theme problems, and thus CyberFur 3 was born
- set before the original, and again crafted by Khirsah and a few helping
hands.
 Today, Khirsah works alongside the other Admin of the MUSH, sketching out
cities and the tracts of land between them in an ever-growing effort to
create as detailed a world as possible. And he occasionally spams the
other Admin with virtual doughnuts, to make sure he keeps his title as the
Doughnut King.

  <p><h3><tt>Mike</tt></h3></p>
  <blockquote>
 Mike, the server administrator, is an enigma in his own right. He is the
guy that makes sure the server doesn't explode into flames, and is the one
that has direct access to it in case of it failing. His brother played on
Bazil's original MUCK, Iantha, which never got off the ground.
