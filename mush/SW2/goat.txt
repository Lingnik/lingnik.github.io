"BLEEEEEET."
"Get that animal off my Destroyer before I throw both of you out the airlock!" Roars Blackthorne, his carbine being
pulled out. He hasn't been this irked since the last out-of-control kegger.
Sighing, leaning his head back over the edge of the chair, Gavin stands up and says, bravely yet for no reason at all,
"To the airlock, then."
Goat, then, takes charge, and lets out another loud bleet, streaking for Blackthorne's gun, "BLEEEEEEEET." It leaps,
through the air, towards the weapon, mouth wide open.
GAME: Blackthorne checks Blaster: Moderate Success(15). 
GAME: Goat(#3670) checks Dodge (16D+0): 1 3 3 4 1 2 2 1 4 6 1 5 5 6 3|2 for a Heroic+ Success(49).
Screaming across the bridge, Gavin emits a horrible sound!
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!" 
The shot goes awry, and the goat gets ahold of the gun. Blackthorne lets go, and speaks into the intercom. "Inform the
Admiral he will get to taste fried Eats-All tonight."
Goat proceeds to chew the blaster to death.
Diving across the bridge, Gavin attempts to tackle Barnaby and wrestle him to the ground, to save his friend from the
lizard.
GAME: Salitan checks Dancing: Moderate Success(12).
GAME: Goat(#3670) checks Dancing (16D+0, Mod: -7D): 3 4 5 1 4 6 6 4|1 for a Mishap(27).
<Sentinels> Iko's guy: Danul says, "The doors to the ready room, open and there doesn't seem to be a protest from the
guards posted outside. In comes Danul Lantree, Minister of Defense of the New Republic. Thought right now he doesn't
look it, still dressed in his casual civilian clothing, he carries with him a data pad he appearantly is hurridly
reading. "Sorry I'm late I got stopped by a goat leaving Corellia." he smirks as he says it, thinking people woun't
believe him. "It's true. A goat was at the comms on the Retribution. Had me laughing so hard I nearly missed my jump
window. But again I'm sorry I'm late. Please continue don't worry about me I'll get caught up." The fact that Danul was
returning from a vacation and was ill prepared at best for this meeting was another story all together but then, that's
what happens when you get in system and get flooded with sensative communications from the defense department. Looking
around he wonders where his deputy is, she should atleast be here. Ohwell he sighs and moves further into the ready
room, continuing to glance over the material presented to him on his data pad. Atleast his aid was effecient." 
GoatDEAD> Goat's spine snaps as Salitan tackles him, and he bleets fatally, falling over. Its head twists for him to
look at Salitan with sadness. "Bleeeeet," It bleets, weakly, "Bleeeeeeet. Bleeeeeeeeeeeet." It blinks, slowly, and
stares at Salitan one last time, nibbling at him one, last, time. "Bleet, bleet," It adds, before slumping to the
ground, dead.
<Sentinels> Iko's guy: Danul says, "<Com:001.00> <VSD_Retribution> A male voice says, "Transport ~Unity~, cut engines
immediately and list captain, passengers, cargo, and destination." <Com:001.00> <VSD_Retribution> An undistinguishable
voice says, "Bleeeeeeet.""
<45 minutes later>
Leaning over the fallen goat, the whimpering bleets bring tears to the General's face. Looking down at his now-deceased
friend, Gavin lies down next to Barnaby and quietly pets his side, with an occasional sniffle.
