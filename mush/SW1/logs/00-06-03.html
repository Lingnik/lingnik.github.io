<p>Players Involved: Brouillard, Ernie, Loy_Marin, Salonika, Vauki, Arands,
  Dydron</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Brouillard's Description:
 You see before you a tall young woman in her late twenties. She has long
dark hair thats falls below her waist. Her eyes are blue/grey framed with
long dark lashes.Her complexion is light with a soft pink blush to her
cheeks and lips.
        Brouillard is wearing a fullbody, slate green jumpsuit with
blackish splotches on it. The jumpsuit appears to be armor-reinforced
from beneath, and has numerous pockets to allow the marine to store
items. A duty jacket is worn over the jumpsuit, covered by several
patches and insignias. A silver tri-braid rope encircles the left
shoulder. A charcoal gray beret rests on her head with a small brass pin
on it. The pin is the Marine Support Unit insignia.
        Across her left chest area is a dull-gray patch with the name
Nicole Brouillard-Batrad imprinted on it.

<p>Ernie's Description:
A human looking figure is before you. He seems in his very early
twenties. He is roughly 1.9 meters tall and of average build. His short
cropped light brown hair does little to hide his sar spots as they march
upon his olive skin from his scalp, down his temples, under his chin and
beyond. His hazel eyes sparkle when not intently focused on some task.
Billowing around Ernie's torso is a sheer, short sleeved tunic. Soft
avocado glimmers in the light, silken threads with traces of ambered
glaze. Deep olive trousers hug snuggly at knee, chopped short to allow
freedom of movement while sturdy fabric could stand up to nearly any use.

<p>Loy_Marin's Description:
        Before you is a man of striking qualities. There is nothing plain
or ordinary about the fellow, from his perfectly coiffed brown hair to
his broad shouldered build. His skin is a well tanned caucasian, and his
waist is slim, though it is uncertain whether this is due to a regiment
of diet and proper exercise, or simply the work of skilled surgeons paid
gross amounts of money to make the man look good. His face is made up of
smooth angles and unblemished skin, befitting a man giving
world-shattering news or trying to sell a used airspeeder. In short, he
expels arrogant confidence and unheralded reliability with a glance,
oozing good will and competency as a Rancor might dribble drool out the
side of its horribly misshapen mouth.
        Loy's clothing fits the man in ways beyond the usual definition
of the word. A blue suit accentuates his sculpted features, the Corellian
cut tailored to fit his form perfectly. The suit is made up of a cerulean
blazer with matching pants, complimented by a fashionable tie and simple,
black loafers. Though the outfit itself is nothing particularly fancy, it
reaks of good taste and high expense in the way a racy new sports speeder
impresses danger and excitement.</p>
<p>Salonika's Description:
        You see a human male standing just over 6' tall. His frame is
thick and muscular and his face is tanned deeply from the sun. He has jet
black hair hanging just beneath his shoulder blades with bangs nearly
reaching his eyes that look like they were cut with a sharp rock. His
eyes are a burning green full of life and health. His face carries a
heavy black beard.
        Salonika is wearing a maroon turtleneck sweater, indicating him
as a Fleet Command Officer. Over this is a midnight-blue duty jacket that
closes off-center and diagonally. A single tribraid rope encircles the
left shoulder.
        Across his left chest area is a dull-gray namepatch with the name
Salonika Batrad imprinted on it. Adorning his collar is his rank
insignia. A silver starburst on a golden bar indicates his rank to be Sar
Admiral. His black tailored pants are crisply pressed and extend down to
cover the black dress boots worn on his feet.

<p>Vauki's Description:
        A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face,
worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of
scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his
upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn,
threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other
locations. Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very
loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests
loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump
created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a
pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which
rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of
it is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the
edges of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas
holster, in which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming
softly under any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black
leather, almost militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no
shine, and reach nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost
scoundral-like demeanor.

<p>Arands' Description:
        A powerfully built man who's eyes and smile belie the
younger-looking physique. Averaging these two factors, an guess that he
is somewhere in his mid to late twenties is close to accurate. His light
brown hair is cut short but there is still enough length to throw off
immediate suspicion that the man is a military 'lifer'. The hazel eyes
sparkle, but a careful observer might notice a sadness in them at the
oddest moments. The edge of the cornea tint brown or green, depending
upon his outlook. He's rather average in height, no more than 5 foot ten
inches tall. On his left hand, he wears a platinum and gold wedding band
with a tiny band of small sapphires and emeralds cutting diagonally
across.
        Arands is wearing a black, long-sleeved collar-less shirt that
seems to stretch to fit him. Over the shirt, he usually is wearing a
waist-length, tan jacket made of nerf-hide. The leather has been softened
and darkened by age and wear.  The jacket is rugged enough to withstand
harsh elements, yet light enough not to be cumbersome. His black pants
are in good condition, perhaps even recently purchased. They are tucked
into a pair of black leather boots, made of the same soft nerf-hide his
jacket is. Worn low on his left thigh is a blaster, strapped into a
rugged black holster.</p>

<p>Dydron's Description:</p>
<p>You see a mid height average looking man with a small scar under his
chin. His blonde brown hair is parted in the center and hangs just over
his ears. He wears a dark brown leather jacket over and untucked white
shirt and black dress type pants. He has a holster hanging from his belt
but there is no blaster to be seen. Unshaven for a few days, he is not
the cleanest guy you have met but he doesn't smell.</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Fountain Square - Plaxton City</p>
<p>The huge buildings in the background threaten to take over this
small patch of green that is the center of Plaxton City. A stone fountain
-still in place from another time- sits in the center of the square. It
depicts a young woman looking into the sky. Water flares around her and
bursts into a star pattern ten feet above her head. The inscription at
the base of the fountain is written in the aging language of a more
romantic time. 'Farewell, for all journeyers that leave this place shall
always return to call it home.'
        Newly planted, lush trees now dominate the square, shading the
area from the night sky above is clear. Dark bushy leaves cover the
branches, offering shade for the ground below. Patches of well maintained
grass surround the base of the trees, allowing space for visitors to
relax or picnic. The central, most famous area of Plaxton City, seems to
become more and more park-like with the frequent additions and
maintnence. A pair of Marines quietly watch over the area.</p>

<p>Pallando gets his feet under him standing shin deep in the fountain
itself, his board having flung off to Solus knows where. He rests hand on
a dripping blaster as he assess the threat and galnces to the normal
posts for the marines that keep the peace in this area. Recognizing the
uniformed man as his direct CO only adds to further focus his energies on
the fray as he steps over the foutain's edge to the park like turf.</p>
<p>The posted marines show no interest in getting involved with this
situation. They believe that the Sar Admiral has everything under control
and will call on them if needed. The chuckle and poke each other as they
watch the struggle.</p>
<p>Brouillard reaches the fountain itself and watches in disbelief as her
husband is obviously overpowering the smaller man, she turns her head in
time to see Captain Pallando step ot of the fountain. Her mouth opens and
closes a few times as she looks back and forth between the fight and the
dripping Captain. She finally says incredulosly, "Ernie? Can't you...do
something?"</p>
<p>Drawing in a ragged breath, filling his lungs once more after they'd been
emptied after being slammed to the hard concrete...  wow, there's going
to be bruises later, if he's in any shape to feel them, that is... Loy
looks the officer back in the eye.  He reaches deep, trying to find
enough dignity and courage to maintain eye contact. Perhaps if he can
display enough courage and honor under this duress, it might trigger
enough respect in the fellow that he'll think things through a little. He
says as loud as he can, "Think this through, before you do something
you'll really regret. Think of your family."</p>
<p>Finally one of the senior NCO's sees what is going on and orders the
guards to break up the situation. "Damn privates." He is heard muttering
as a pair of them rush towards the men.</p>
<p>Salonika grinds his teeth together as he speaks. "I am thinking of my
family. What were you thinking about? Who is your source? TELL ME!!"
Salonika draws back an arm and is about to punch Loy. "TELL ME!!" He
repeats.</p>
<p>Arands strolls casually along Blake street, coming from the government
section of the city. The New Republic general is in his civvies and looks
to be out to see the city he called home not so long ago.</p>
<p>Vauki saunters into the square slowly, trodding his feet delicately in
front of him. His hands are gently residing in his trouser pockets, his
eyes to the ground. With a saddened look on his face, he wanders forth
into the square, not paying attention to anything or anything. It had
been a while since he was here. He didn't think it would affect him quite
/this/ much.</p>
<p>Pallando is distracted from the one sided brawl only enough to take in
Nicole's plea to him. He notes that the marines are moving to break it up
and and he steps forward as well, "Easy Salonika, easy there you've got
this on in custody." He says with a soothing calmness as he continues his
apprach, still some 8 meters away from the fray.</p>
<p>Dydron runs quickly in and up to the news terminal with a interested
looked on his face. He chances a glance in the way of the comotion but
seems not affected. He then hurriedly trys to get some money from his
wallet, but it seems to be caught in his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>This is it, really. The toss of the toss, the shift of the Sabacc chip,
the turn of the slot's wheel. Summoning up his courage one last time, Loy
looks the man in the eye and says, "If you're a man of honor, then you'll
understand when I say that I have sworn not to divulge my sources, and I
-am- a man of honor." There. His last gambling chip, and his last chance
at getting out of this with his face in tact. Will the soldier listen?</p>
<p>Salonika leans in close once more time. "If you were a man of honor you
wouldn't have printed that trash without finding out the facts. If you
think writing that Joshua Arands is the father of my child and plastering
it all over the universe is honorable then you have the honor of a rat."
He fumes. "You know what I do to rats? I kill them." He draws back once
again to punch the man.</p>
<p>As Batrad draws back once more to strike, Loy flinches as he blurts with
all the dignity of a stricken child, "I didn't write the story, I read
it!" If terror was any sort of indication of sincerity, then the fear in
Loy's eyes at the moment would be compelling.</p>
<p>Pallando blinks as realization of Salonika's rage dawns upon him. Both
the identity of the target and he justifiable reason for a sound beating.
He makes no move from his stunned state to halt the punching wind up
though his feet do carry him with in range of the hand to hand
combatants.</p>
<p>Brouillard watches as Ernie approaches the fight and calls out,
"Salonika! Stop!" Just as the words leave her mouth she hears her
husbands words to the man and gasps, stunned for a second before yelling
out, "Hit him Sal, hit him hard."</p>
<p>Salonika leaves his hand hovering over Loys face. "Where did you /read/
this damn fairy tale?"</p>
<p>Pallando seems a bit dissappointed that the knuckles did not strike that
face of the vermin that reported he was a lack luster senatorial canidate
due to 'Doesmestic trouble.' He sets his teeth on edge gridning them. He
gives warning look to the Marine officer as if telepathizing to back off
and let this be settled man to worm.</p>
<p>None of what's going on, of course, is any of Vauki's business, if he
even notices. His solemn face hangs down, peering as he feet carry him to
who knows where. For a moment, he raises the head to peer around,
glancing at the commotion, the faces, the people. But, the moment passes,
and Vauki once again lowers his face to the ground. 'Why can't people get
along better,' are the words echoing through his mind right now... he's
almost fed up with it, but he keeps his outward mood down, and depressed.</p>
<p>Where? Loy's mind reels from the question. Literally, he recited the
report just a few feet from where he's being assaulted now. Of course,
his mind rejects that answer as bad immediately. He blinks a few times
quickly, then says, "I get my orders just like any soldier..." he pauses
to glance at the man's uniform, then continues quickly, "Admiral. Do you
think I actually -like- posting that sort of thing?"</p>
<p>Apparently on his way north towards the residential section of town, the
sudden shouting and comotion closer to the center of the square causes
him to pause and glance in that direction. What he sees actually
surprises him. The reporter was there, almost nose to nose with his
friend and Salonika seemed to be the one doing the shouting. As the Sar
Admiral pulls his fist back, Arands forgets where he was going and bolts
toward the pair. Marin seems to be trying to talk hm down calmly, but
Sal's hot retort is all Arands needs to see and hear. He'd known Sal for
a long time. The look on Batrad's face is enough to make him sprint
faster. "Sal!" he shouts. No response or he hasn't heard Arands yet. He
tries one more time as he nears them, "Dagger!"  ((ARANDS))</p>
<p>After Dydron finally gets the money in to the damn terminal the article
in question crosses the screen. Slowly his expression changes from happy
to remoseful and he seriously takes note of the comotion surronding him.
He backs up to a quiet corner of the square and hope that the brawl
generating will not generate in his direction, but still he is curious.</p>
<p>Months of pain, anguish and anger raging in his eyes Salonika draws back
his fist for the final decision on the blow to Loy's face. "Wrong
answer." he mutters as the fist begins its downward arch. Rage is the
only thing Loy can see and it eminates from Salonika's body like a fire
as the fist seems to move in slow motion towards him. Something or some
word clicks in Salonika's head and the fist stops just milimeters from
the nose of the man he holds down. He slowly turns to face the voice
keeping a firm grip on Loy.</p>
<p>Pallando tenses in sickening delighted anticipation of the strike. As
Arands' second mysterious call halts the pay off of the pay load. He
teeters at the edge of climax hovering there on verge of carnal
frusteration.</p>
<p>Loy's face puckers in a flinch as Salonika's fist begins to descend
toward his face. His muscles tighten, his eyelids narrow to almost
closing, and a fleeting thought of regret flickers through his mind. When
the blow doesn't land, Loy's heart pounds at his rib cage like it wants
to jump out and bounce over to the fountain. Flicks of blackness spot the
reporter's vision, and his face goes a sickly pale. Unable to form words,
his eyes roll off in the direction of whoever it was that called out.  
Could it be that he actually still has a friend in this blasted system?</p>
<p>Brouillard looks up as Josh Arands calls out to her husband and his fist
stops mid-air. Amazingly she isn't sure she wants him to stop,</p>
<p>Arands is within speaking distance now and he slows his approach now that
he's certain he has Salonika's attention. "Let him go, Sal..." he says
evenly. It's not a request but neither is it an order. Whether the
reporter deserved a thrashing or not, the open fountain square was the
wrong place to do it... "He's not worth it and you know it." Now standing
no more than two feet away from Salonika, he crosses his arms. He nods
slightly towards some of those gathering around. The Caspian public.  
And their eyes were on the pair on the ground. "Come on... let's you and
me go have a drink." His voice is and has been low enough so that only
those close by can hear.</p>
<p>Salonika hovers over Loy with his fist still a hair away from his face.
He looks at Arands like he is a speaking dog, not really understanding
what he is saying but getting the jist of it. He looks around the square
quickly and composes himself a bit, but not much. His eyes cross that of
his wifes and then looks back to Arands and offers a little shrug before
drawing the hand back again to hit the man who made a rapid decent to the
bottom of his personal list. "One last chance rat. Where did you get the
information?"</p>
<p>Pallando seems perhaps even more effected by Arandssoothign words than
the Sar Admiral. Hs tension and desrie for the reporter to meet violent
end vanish under Josh's logic that banish the emotional level pent up
with in him. AS the wet fro mthe fountain drip form him so too does his
own rage at Loy.</p>
<p>Marcus walks up the street from the south, whistling a tune to himself.
The tune quickly dies as he blinks at the scene greeting his eyes, taking
a look around and mingling with the crowd to watch, thumbs hooked in his
belt.</p>
<p>Brouillard rubs her forehead gently, trying to get her wits about her
once more. She takes a few steps towards her husband and pleads quietly,
"Let it end Salonika, he isn't worth it, just let it end." At that moment
she realizes the only thing in the world she wants is to be away from
this crowd.</p>
<p>For a moment, Vauki's mindless wanderings falter, as he stumbles upon a
misplaced piece of rock. He stops in his tracks, looking up around the
scene again... sighing, he pushes himself over to a nearby bench, and
plops himself down. With slow measures, he pulls a datapad from his
trousers, tapping it to life. A solitary hand reaches up to stroke at the
golden chain wrapped around his neck slowly, quietly observing the small
screen.</p>
<p>It's really almost too much for Loy. Like a ragdoll, he hangs limply from
from Salonika's left fist, even as the soldier's right is poised to
strike. He lifts his head to at least try and keep it level as he's
looking in the man in the face, but having come that close to fainting,
it sways weakly. With a voice that's weak to the point of being barely
audible, he tries to speak, but all the emerges is, "I... I..." It's
unclear now if the man is shaking his head, or if it's merely weakness.  
Every man has a limit to what they can take, and Loy seems to be well
past it.</p>
<p>"Shavas!" Arands curses as Salonika threatens the reporter once again.
His eyes narrow and his words come out with an edge.  "Admiral Batrad!"
Arands barks at the CDF officer. His arms uncross and his left hand falls
to the grip of his sidearm. He knows the Marines nearby will react, but
Arands has already keyed him comlink and triggered the emergency beacon,
just in case. He leans down, one hand still on the butt of his weapon,
but no where near trying to pull the weapon. "I am taking Mr.  Marin into
protective custody, Admiral. Please unhand him..." He pauses for just a
moment, his eyes now level with Salonika's as he adds in a calm,
calculating voice. "Now, Admiral..."</p>
<p>Salonika looks up at Arands. "Have YOU lost your mind?" He shoots a quick
look at the senior NCO on duty in the square and gives him a not so
subtle nod. The NCO stares wide eyed for a moment before getting on his
com. Salonika turns back to Arands. "This isn't the embassy my /friend/,
you have NO authority on Caspian soil." He says sarcasticly. "Now back
the hell away from me." He looks down at Loy again. "I tire of these
games. It is time for you to decide which is more important. Your source
or your face?"</p>
<p>Pallando listens to the once rational sounding Arands but as the new
republican forieng alien begins to make rash pronouncements about custody
his own hand, like those of the marines about him fall to his own side
arm in clear sign of protestation to the visting Genernal. He nods his
agreement of Batrad's words that stop his own form issueing protest to
Arands.</p>
<p>Marcus looks around again, spotting Vauki, and backs slowly out of the
crowd. He makes his way towards Vauki's bench, carefully sitting down next
to Mege when he gets there, leaning back and tipping his cap back on his
head. He glances at Vauki, speaking quietly to him, "Hey... What's goin'
on here, Mege?"</p>
<p>Vauki blinks softly at the datapad for a moment, before turning his head
up to the younger man, "Oh, hey Marc... I dunno know. Some kinda rucus
'tween that reporter guy, Marin, or whatever his name is, and those
Casps." He shrugs, "I was just reading through some stuff I picked up from
the spaceport.... waiting for everyone else to wake up."</p>
<p>With quite the frown on his face, Diggs walks rather swiftly into the
square, tailed by two younger men. Jonau Diggs, well into his fifties by
now, may be older than most, but he's still fit. His eyes dart around the
crowd swiftly, before finally spotting Arands. The three Intel agents are
each armed, bearing blasters at their sides. The older man leads the way
for the other two, swiftly moving towards Arands.</p>
<p>The newsman, once dapper but now seriously tassled, with his hair hanging
limply across part of his face, his face still partially white, now
partially red as blood begins to flow normally again... draws in a ragged
breath, and some of his strength returns. His eyes flicker wildly about
the rapidly tensing square, and once more, his wits begin to return to
him.  This is a bad situation, and though he still has his facial
structure in tact, it might not remain so. The threat is still there, the
fist still balled in rage and prepared to strike. Gritting his teeth, Loy
presses on with his previous tactic of trying to reason with the man.
"Listen, if you do this, there's no way I'm going to be able to post a
suitable retraction to this story."</p>
<p>Arands drops his hand from the butt of his blaster and instead drops to
one knee next to Sal, no more than six inches from Salonika and his
victim. "Or what, Admiral? You going to assault me next because my name
was in that article too?" he asks in a low growl. "/This/ is the freedom
you fight for here on Caspar now? The freedom to censor others by physical
force?" With Loy's words, Arands doesn't even turn his head to address the
reporter. "Shut up." Arands keeps his eyes on Salonika as he waits for the
other to make up his mind.</p>
<p>At this point Nicole sincerely wants this fight to be over, but she knows
her husband well enough to know he will do it his way. She stands back
realizing the toll the last few months have taken on him, and simply prays
the outcome of this fight will do no more harm to the psyche of her
husband.</p>
<p>Benjawa enters the square from the north.
Benjawa has arrived.</p>
<p>Dydron notices the suuden increase in tension,as if he couldn't. Assesing
the situation from a non-involed point of view he seems to nod to himself,
and make his way around the fountain, putting the action and the NRI on
the other side. He then stares careful through the falling water at the
General of the New Republic waiting to see what evoles.</p>
<p>Pallando takes note of other arriving Republican armed men and fades back
from the scene to call in reinforcements if the Marine officer has not all
ready. What ever transpires over hte com causes him to head north fro mthe
square.</p>
<p>Ernie leaves the square to the north.
Ernie has left.</p>
<p>Marcus ahhs quietly at Vauki, nodding. "Rucus." He crosses his arms over
his chest, watching the tense exchange, shifting so he can dive off the
bench and seek safety if things take a turn for the worst. He glances at
Diggs and the other newly-arrived NRI personel, sighing and muttering half
to himself and have to Mege, "Rucus is bad...</p>
<p>Salonika speaks in a low growl as he looks at Arands. "I am about three
seconds from having you and your men arrested for carrying arms on Caspian
soil." He turns back to Loy. "This isn't about censorship. Censorship is
the concealment of fact, this is pure fiction." He turns back to Arands.
"This man is neither on your soil nor a New Republic citizen so unless you
fear that I may beat the truth out of him and it does involve you I would
stand down."</p>
<p>"Yeah... maybe we should go. If one of them guards starts shooting, I
don't want to catch a stray blast with my head... not to mention, I don't
like public places in general." Mege slowly tucks the datapad back into
his trousers, peering across the crowds... quietly thinking to himself.</p>
<p>Jonau and his guards push through the gathered peoples, before stopping a
few meters before Arands, "General?" The intel officer peers down at the
conflict slowly, keeping a keen eye occasionally up towards the various
other Casperian guards. He gets a mysterious calling from Arands, only to
find himself in the midst of armed Casperians. Not the best evening's
greeting.</p>
<p>The tension is palpable in the square, and Loy can feel the pressure
settling down hard on him, right in the center. Slate gray eyes move from
the Caspian military man, threatening to do him physical harm, and the New
Republic military man, attempting to bring reason into play. The reporter
knows full well what this could turn into... beyond his own pain lies a
potential conflict that could leave both Caspar and the New Republic even
weaker in the face of the farter greater threat that is the Empire, and
their new superweapon. Loy opens his mouth to speak, wanting to bring this
truth to light, but he stops short. Any word he could say now would only
create further tension. He draws in a deep breath, silently praying the
Maker keep him from harm.</p>
<p>The window darkened RepulsorLimo of FLS origin coasts to a stop near the
limits of the square. It's sole occupant, one Ben Jawatha CEO of
aformentioned company, steps out before the driver can get back to open
the door. It seems this is not a unprecidented manuvuer on Jawatha's part
as the driver just returns to his seat. Ben takes a moment to look about,
and his eyes land squarely on the rucus playing out currently. He
hesitates for a moment, not recognizing the participants. When the
familiar sounds of the Sar Admiral reach is ears, he begins walking
towards the 'fun'. As he nears, he can now make out those he would
recognize. He frowns, but continues makeing he way towards the area,
making note of whom has ahold of whom, and understanding immeadatly why.
He arrives near enough to be seen, if not right away, and cocks a
questioning brow towards Arands, when and if the man looks his way. Ben
made sure that his footfalls could be heard, as the tension is felt.</p>
<p>Rachet enters the square from the south.
Rachet has arrived.</p>
<p>A small squad of marines appear from the south evidently activated from
Trinum base. They trot in with heavy blasters drawn.  The stop short of
the activity and the squad leader moves to the senior NCO on the watch.
Seeing the other marines enter with balsters drawn the six on duty in the
square do the same as an instinctive reaction. No one looks like they are
ready to pull a trigger but they are prepared.</p>
<p>Arands raises an eyebrow, then rises to his feet. He's already spotted the
Diggs and his backup and it reminds him to key off his comlink. He does
this as he holds up one hand to tell Diggs to back off. With the other he
unbuckles his gunbelt. "Would that make you feel better?" He tosses the
gunbelt to land at Diggs' feet. "False alarm. It seems _Admiral_ Batrad
has decided it's okay to pummel defenseless people just because he can."
Arands has returned his gaze to Salonika, but his next words are orders -
apparently for Diggs. "Return to the embassy. I'll be right behind you."
Without waiting for confirmation, he takes a second to glance down at Loy
with disgust on his face, but he doesn't agree with nor approve of the
man's methods. "So what'll it be, Sal? You want to beat him to death?
Cause you're going to have to either arrest me or go through me first."  
His eyes narrow and his face hardens. "You hit him... I hit you. Then we
see where it takes us, shall we?"</p>
<p>Not far behind the marines, standing perhaps a head taller than all of
them, Mr Rachet stands. He, unlike the Marines from Trinum Base, is
unarmed although obviously an officer. And like many of the lookie-loos
that are probably circling and watching the events unfold, he here was
attracted by the people, not so much by the crackled command over the
intercom.  Watching as the Marines reach their destination, Rachet frowns
and crosses the street to search out what may be the cause of the ruckus.</p>
<p>The well-aged NRI agent simply bends down and grasps the belt up, thus
turning towards his agents, "Let's go." Diggs makes his way past them
quickly, pushing once again through the mess of people gathered. His two
tails follow intently, right behind his step, and the three disappear into
the eastern streets.</p>
<p>Salonika turns back to Loy and speaks rather civily to the man he is about
to grind into dust. "You're lucky not to have any friends you piece of
trash. See what they do for you. They threaten you as you defend your
family." He turns back to Arands.  "You dissappoint me." He looks back at
Loy. "Which will it be? Your source or your face? I want an answer."</p>
<p>The Admirals wife watches silently as her husband continues his tirade
against the reporter.</p>
<p>Marcus sighs and pulls his cap low over his eyes as he watches -more-
soldiers arrive with guns drawn, sinking down a little lower in the bench
next to Vauki. He gives Ben a curious glance as he arrives, then returns
to paying attention to the tense conflict brewing, blinking at Arands'
statement and Diggs' departure.</p>
<p>Civility is usually a nice change, but Loy has covered some of the worst
murders the galaxy has known, and in so many of those reports, onlookers
claimed that the attackers suddenly seemed peaceful and calm as they did
their worst. It's the last thread of sanity or morality, leaving the mind.
For not the first time in Loy's life, the reporter wishes to himself that
he might have been exposed to less of this choice information. Still, he
manages to maintain some semblance of confidence as he says, "Whether it
be from me or someone else, there will be another story after this. The
choice is actually yours... will the story feature me apologizing publicly
for the harm brought to you and your family, or will it be a feature on
military brutality in the Caspian system?"</p>
<p>Benjawa sees this is about to get ugly and quickens his pace. Noting to
himself that this would not be good press if the star reporter for IGN
get's decked by the Sar Admiral of the CDU, Ben makes his best effort to
interject as quickly as possible.  He shouts to his friend, "Josh, hey."
And continues making his way towards the participants. Now that he is
close enough he has to weave through the crowd, slowing his pace a bit.
"Damn it, get out of the way. Josh don't you do it" He shouts as he get's
even closer. He breaks through the crowd, not sure if his interjection is
going to do any good or not.</p>
<p>Arands shakes his head as the adrenaline rush starts to wear off. "This
isn't defending your family, Sal. This is assault with intent to kill."
Arands' shoulders sag just slightly. "I disappoint you? I'm not the one
with his fist poised above a civilian's face with murder in his eyes."
Arands turns his head as Benjawa breaks through the crowd nearby. "I guess
the fact that I'm not like you is reason enough to disappoint you? How
Imperial." And with that, the New Republican general turns away and shoves
his way through the crowd - away from all of them and towards East Blake.</p>
<p>Salonika watches as Arands walks away. He turns back to Loy and lowers his
balled fist to his side. "You will never understand what you have cost me
tonight." With that he pushes the reporter back with his and begins to
stand.</p>
<p>Feeling a shaking in his paocket, Dydron realises his comlink is calling
him, and he swears in corellian. Taking the comlink out of his pocket, he
says a few works then a disapointed look crosses his face. He then shrugs
and heads hastily away from the now dimishing tension.</p>
<p>Dydron walks down East Blake St.
Dydron has left.</p>
<p>The reporter would have fallen to the ground had he simply been let go,
but with the added shove, it's an assured thing.  Landing hard on his
posterior, Loy emits a short grunt of discomfort and pain, then leans back
on his left hand as e raises his right to the spot on his chest where he
was shoved. It's only then that relief washes over the man, and again, he
becomes a little light headed. He leans back on both hands, letting his
head fall loosely back, his face to the thankfully clear skies above. How
close had he come to his own demise? Had he actually been in greater
mortal danger here, with a single man, than he had been on a ship and in
the presence of the Imperial Death Star? He lets out a ragged sigh and
begins to wonder where this is all going to end.</p>
<p>Marcus lets out a quiet sigh to himself as things seem to take a few steps
back from the brink of violence, leaning his head back and closing his
eyes for a moment before looking at the scene once more, his hands
slipping into his coat pockets.</p>
<p>The squad leader waves to his men to stand down and they holster their
weapons. The begin milling about breaking up the crowd.</p>
<p>Vauki slowly crosses his own arms, sighing slightly. His head begins to
shake, and he utters out to his companion, "Disgustin', ain't it, bro?" He
fingers twiddle against his arms as he peers at the remaining collection
of people.</p>
<p>Salonika pushes through the crowd and heads north towards his home.</p>
<p>Marcus nods a bit, speaking quietly to Vauki, "Among other things that
could be used to describe this, yes, disgusting fits."</p>
<p>Oportunity knocks very seldom, and Ben's awefully good at knowing when to
open the door. Makeing no more moves towards the Admiral or his friend
Arands, Ben turns to Loy and extends a hand to help the guy to his feet.
"Mr. Marin, how nice to see you. Let me help you up here."</p>
<p>Salonika leaves the square to the north.
Salonika has left.</p>
<p>Loy raises his head wearily to look at the man offering him a helping
hand, and his eyes light up with recognition. If he ever needed proof that
the Maker had a sense of humor, Benjamin Jawatha, another man that has
been at bad end of publicity wrought by Loy's own hand, now offering
assistance, is it. With a weak, bitter laugh, Loy accepts the offered
assistance and rises wobbily to his feet. He runs a shaking hand through
his hair in an effort to straight his appearance somewhat, then says,
"Mister Jawatha. It's a pleasure to see you, too."</p>
<p>"It's a wonde' the 'public and Caspar aren't at war, the way they's always
bickerin'." Mege grins softly, and pokes an elbow gently into Marcus'
side, "Let's get back to ship. Nothin' much left to see, eh?" He reaches a
single hand to his neck to stroke at the gold chain again, before catching
himself.... he should really stop that. After a moment, he adds, "Maybe we
got message from Tat..."</p>
<p>Understanding the Loy may realize what Ben is up to, Ben grins a bit at
the man and then returns to his usual public outward appearance. "Seems
the reporting business can get a bit dangerous these days eh?. I'd say you
were due for a hefty drink in a place a bit safer than here. I don't
beleive you've seen Enterprise Towers yet." Ben implies heavily as he
converses with the man. What ever Ben expects out of what may or may not
come does not show at all, just the practiced look of a public official.</p>
<p>Marcus chuckles and nods at the poke from Mege, standing and readjusting
his cap on his head, "Yah... A message would be nice right about now, eh
Mege?"</p>
<p>Resting one hand on Benjawa's shoulder for support, Loy raises his other
hand in front of him to study it, watching as it still shakes from the
still ebbing adrenaline rush. He looks from his hand to Benjawa, his brow
furrowed. He says, "Mister Jawatha, I realize that what you may have scene
on the news is bad, and I know you'd like to rebutt. I don't think I'm in
any shape for that, though. Not tonight. Tomorrow, after I've had a chance
to recover from tonight's assault, I would be honored to receive a full
tour of your Caspian headquarters, and would be more than pleased to
receive your hospitality and your Senatorial spin. For now, I think I
should just sit on one of these benches until I can walk to my ship."</p>
<p>Arands walks down East Blake St.
Arands has left.</p>
<p>Mege simply nods, "Yes, it would be very nice right about now..." He
stands slowly, stretching out, tiredly; suddenly, though, the datapad from
his trousers falls out from it's spot, clattering noisily on the ground.
He reaches down to pick it up, muttering under his breath, "Sithspawn..."
With that, he turns to Marcus, his datapad clasped firmly in hand, "Let's
go."</p>
<p>Benjawa chuckles and then shakes his head, "Whatever you may think, Mr
Marin, I assure you that the hospitality is just that.  You and I are both
professionals. The offer is exactly what it is, a drink and a safe place
to rest. I can even have your ship brought up to the Tower untill you are
ready to leave. But, understand one thing, what happened here tonight is
not something that will be forgotten by either side. You contact me
tomarrow and I'll do my rebutting, and then I'll take the time to help you
out a little bit. Sometimes good can come from bad situations."</p>
<p>"Again, thank you for your kind offer," Loy says. He holds his hand out in
front of him once more, and happily, he seems to have recovered from the
shakes. "Rest assurred, I will contact you tomorrow. Perhaps we'll both be
able to help each other."</p>
<p>Marcus glances at the pad as it falls and nods to Mege, hands in his coat
pockets and following quietly.</p>
<p>Benjawa nods once and flashes the man a smile, and then heads towards his
awaiting limo.</p>
<p>In his typical self-assured manner, Vauki sets off to the south, leading
the tailing Marcus behind him.</p>
