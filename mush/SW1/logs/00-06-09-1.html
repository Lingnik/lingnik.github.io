<p>Background:</p>
<p>Vauki's Description:
        Prominantly displayed on this man's body is an entirely black
jumpsuit, of some flexible yet stiff material. The material covers his
entire body, save his hands and feet, and the head atop his shoulders. A
solitary stiff black piece of the familiar material is wrapped about his
neck tightly, leaving very little exposed on his body. His feet are clad
in simple black leather boots, while his hands and head remain exposed
completely. The only real thing standing out on him is a simple slap-on
style KIF logo patch on the left breast. The garb seems to have very few
seams, only a solitary visible one residing at the very front, extending
all the way down to the crotch from his neck.
        His skin is well tan, his hands worn and rough. The face is just
as rough, if not more, a solitary long scar running diagonally across his
face, ending in a pink spot near his chin. Various other smaller scars
reside over his young, yet worn, face. The eyes are clear and bright,
shining forth a bright green, striking against the well-ravaged skin. The
scar on his face slices through a piece of his left eyebrow, leaving a
piece of it gone, the hairs having not grown back still. The hair atop his
head reflects youth of an age gone past, tinted green at the tips, and
growing progressively darker to black at the roots. He keeps the hair
straight up, poking into the sky like some sort of surreal cityscape.</p>

<p>Luther_Syss' Description:
        This young black-haired man stands at an height of 1.75 m with an
ease that reeks of self-confident and pride. The ones familiar with the
different species around the galaxy would emidiate notice this man beeing
a Sarian, hard to miss with the pitchblack Sar Spots coming down from the
hairline on each temple, continuing down the neck of his clothing. The
ones very known to the races would even manage to understand he is a
Meditersarian from the complexion of his tanned bronze skin, the dark eyes
and the long black hair tied back in his neck into a ponytail that reaches
his midback.
        The clothes, underneath his black duster there is a black tunic
with beautiful ornated buttons running down from the high collar. The
tunic itself is made of some fine fabric, silk-like yet still the way it
reflects the light suggest something else, what?, hard to say. The high
collar has a small gap in the front inorder to make it comfortably and not
too sufficating to wear. At the height of midthigh a pair of black pants
appear from under the tunic and they are made in some rough fabric that
seems endurable for hard work, quite a contrast to the fabric of the
tunic. Around his waist sits a belt fastened with a number of small packs
and pouches attached to it, how many is hard to see because of the duster
that conceals most of it. His black boots matches his black pants in
endurability for hard work or long traveling by foot.
        The right side of his face is covered by a black fantastic ornate
ritualistic tattoo that goes from mid forehead, involves the Sar Spots in
its complexed pattern down the right side of the face to the chin where a
few lines continues down with the Sar Spots into the line of clothing. On
his forehead though there is a spot left unmarked by tattoos in the shape
of a halfmoon if you will. The back of his hands are covered with the same
type of tattoo as on his face, spreading out on his fingers as small black
delicate tentacles that end at the nails while continuing up under the
sleeves of his duster. If knowing the cultures of the planet Mergansar
well you might recollect the ritualistic patterns as Ghankha tribal
tattoos.</p>

<p>Staging Area -- Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena</p>
<p>Open and spacious, the staging area is bordered by high-grade security
fencing on three sides, and the arena. The viewing stands above wings out
to overhang the area, several repair shops and the stable house built
along the wall on the ground beneath it. High pylons suspend a transparent
arc of wide plasteel panels and thin durasteel mesh over the rest of the
area, stopping twenty feet over the security fencing to allow the sun and
wind to enter, but none of the accompanying inclement weather. Bay doors
on either side lead to the track and back out to the street, and a smaller
security door on the arena wall provides access to the spectator
facilities inside. Track security patrols the well-lit area frequently.</p>

<p>"They had /better/ get the swoops here soon. I need some practice,
sith-be-damned." The prominant voice of a man is ushered forth from the
KIF areas. There, several racers talk amongst themselves, including an
entirely black-clad man, from whence the voice came.</p>
<p>A young Meditersarian arrives through one of the bay doors, gazing around
with narrowed dark eyes, looking over the Staging Area, slightly lost
expression on the otherwise curious face. He raises a hand to shield the
eyes from the bright light, getting a view of where he have ended up. With
a smile he makes way for a couple of people hurrying pass him before
returning to his explorations.</p>
<p>The group of races talk amongst themselves quietly, before the black-clad
man grins, and offers a short half-wave to the group, "I ought to get out
of here. I need to track down some people 'fore the swoops get here.
Hopefully." With that, Vauki turns and sets off for the entrance, his path
generally the opposite of Luther's.</p>
<p>Luther_Syss doesn't seems to have any plans on moving for awhile as he
with an almost childish expression on his face takes in the scene
presented to him, probably the first time he is at this place. The eyes
trails away from the wonderful scenes this Staging Area presents and aims
at the approaching human, or more accurately, the team badge on the chest.
He seems to be pondering the meaning of the badge as the swooper man
closes in. The eyes raises to meet the mans, nodding slightly in greeting.</p>
<p>Mege's course falters slightly as he eyes the man in his path. A smile
brushes over his already elated mood, and he bobs his head in reply, "Good
afternoon, there. Can I help ya with something?" There's a bit of an
accent though, but the voice is masked heavily in what must be years of
experience and education; diplomats, politicians, intelligence, and
big-name businessmen. Those sorts, of course, to anyone who follows swoop
races, aren't uncommon here. In fact, there's almost sickeningly common.
But, the man's appearance doesn't /seem/ to be any of those. On the
outside, of course.</p>
<p>As if strucked by Vader's gaze the Meditersarian stands silent for a
moment, abit puzzled perhaps, before he grins slightly.  "Well.." he
begins with a raspy voice, looking around some more. "..if you could
please show me what exit I am supposed to take if I'm to watch the swoop
race I would be most grateful." While saying this eyes moves around the
area some before looking back at the man offering his help, adding the
last touch of a friendly grin.</p>
<p>Nodding simply, Vauki replies, "Sure. I'll take you to the stands if you'd
like. I'm headed there myself." He motions back out the way the man came.</p>
<p>Luther_Syss steap aside, raising an arm as if offering the lead position
to the oriented one.</p>
<p>"Follow me... it's right this way." Vauki replies simply, and starts off
out to Victory Lane.</p>
<p>Main Concourse -- Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena</p>
<p>The concourse is spacious, open, and well ventilated, serving as a hub
of activity for the Arena. Large lighting fixtures and banners supporting
both McTavish and Avalon Enterprises hang from the enormously high
ceiling, while fine Corellian stone composes the floor. The central
concourse is twice the size of a ballroom. Wide tunnels pan out from it
along the lower level of the stadium, and are lined with concession areas
and other nooks and crannies designed for tourists. Two large escalators
lead to the viewing stands from the main concourse, with another set of
escalators every so often down each wide tunnel, all the way around the
track. A secured door grants competitors access to the staging area.
Security patrols the concourse frequently.</p>

 &lt;U>p leads to Viewing Stands -- Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena.
 &lt;O>ut leads to Victory Lane - Coronet City.</p>
<p>As Vauki enters into the Concourse, he turns his head slightly to face
Luther, before motioning around, "This is the Concourse... viewing stands
can be gotten to by the escalators over that way," he motions to them.</p>
<p>Luther_Syss follows the gesture with his eyes, tries to find the pointed
escalators, nodding slightly as he founds them.  "Thank you for the help,
I guess I'll be cheering at you then as I presume you're one of the
racers?"</p>
<p>Vauki grins in response, "If you'd like. I'll be racing Grade one for KIF.
Name's Mege Vauki." He extends the roughened hand towards the Sarian.</p>
<p>Luther_Syss grabs the hand in a firm grip with his own tattooed one. "Well
met, I'm Luther Syss."</p>
<p>The grip of the human is quite rough, about as much as it's appearance. He
smiles, and releases the spotted appendage, "Good to meet ya. I'll be at
the awards on the Rancor after the races, with luck, if you manage to get
up there for 'em. I'll probably be busy up til then, 'less I race earlier
than I expect to... Saturday evening. Then I'll be hanging around in the
stands."</p>
<p>The black hair tosses some around the Meditersarians shoulders as he nods,
grining slightly. "I will cross my fingers for you." He gazes around some,
locking the eyes on something for a brief moment before facing the swooper
man again. "Maybe I'll run into you then, I plan on staying here atleast
'till the race's over."</p>
<p>Vauki nods simply in reply, before offering the same half-wave he offered
the previous fellow racers, "Cya round. And thanks." With that, he turns,
and heads off into the crowds, disappearing quickly amongst the swells of
people.</p>
<p>Luther_Syss stands in silent contemplation for a moment before turning on
his heals, sending a small whirl of dust into the air with his duster,
heading towards the escalators with a peaceful pace and a barely audiable
whistle.</p>
