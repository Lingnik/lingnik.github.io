Altair is distracted for a while while a cadet comes up to her and starts asking her for training and for assignement to a squadron. She sighs heavily and instructs him to please go find a training officer. After a few moments, she turns back to the General and the diplomant. "It's just a bit old," she says of the Tydirium, as she has been keeping an ear on the conversation between them.

"Possible," Poguala responds a touch more quietly. "However, I should think we are accusted to shuttle technology, however nefarious its origins." Her acknowledgement of Altair's comment is a kind one. "Indeed. I shant be the one to suggest that the Tydirium be retired, still, it serves us well to consider the craft is venerable."

Skeezix shrugs his shoulders in a minute fasion, though he continues to eye the Tydirium almost in a way most people do when something they own or use frequently isn't working correctly, no matter how much they like it. "She certainly acts like she's older than dirt sometimes," he remarks, turning his attention back to the two before him. "But she flies nice. Well, to me, at least."

Altair chuckles softly at the older than dirt comment. She spots that annoying cadet returning and shoots him a look of warning not to interrupt senior pilots when they were busy talking with obviously important people. Even though her conversation with them was useless, at best.

Poguala mms softly. Again, her lips are pursed pretty, in the quizzical way she tends to look when discussing a subject that is out of her jurisdiction. "She is a fine ship. Perhaps you should speak to tarroc to make certain he made no adjustments she could not handle. You are not the onlyjuior pilot who has been concerned about the modifications." She turns to Altair. "No ship troubles on your end?" The junior officer Altair glared at is givena sympathetic look.

Skeezix nods his head slowly and simply replies, "I know." He turns to glance towards Altair, then takes a step away, turning. It isn't his business to stick his nose in other departments, after all.

Altair had been standing around talking with Skeezix and Poguala for a while now. "Just routine maitenance concerns," she replies to the diplomat. "No major run ins with the imps lately." She leans against the hull of the Tydirium and surveys the hangar. Thinking about it, it was about tiem she went out on patrol.

Skeezix is in the process of moving away from Poguala and Altair, though his eyes rest peculiarly on the hull of the Tydirium.

Lianna returns from being called away by some hyperventilizing technican, who obviously did not pass it's test on energy management, and got a bit afraid as the rerouting nearly shuted down the complete engeneeering level. It took her 40 minutes to figure out what he did, for his babbling made no sense, and about 5 to fix it. Needless to tell, her mood isn't the best right now. Where was she as she left? -- However, Lianna walks towards the small cluster that contains the diplomat and the pilot...

Bazil wanders in from the other bay, his steps light as he meanders his way through the various people, droids, and other junk in the area. His hands are empty, save for a solitary datapad in one hand, which taps lightly against the corresponding leg.

Altair turns to look in the direction of the hull that Skeezix is looking at. She turns her gaze back to him, arching a brow curiously, as if to say, "What?" She psuhes herself off of the aging ship and turns around to look at it, not expecting to find anything.

Skeezix shakes his head to and fro, glancing back to Altair after doing so. "Is something wrong?" he asks, turning to look back at the Tydirium as if he missed something. "I didn't notice anything..?"

Lianna blinks at the hull as well, now that two out of three have turned to look at it. Stepping up to the group she mutters a "Greetings.",half-heartly. "Yeah, what's up with it?".

Altair shrugs as she turns back around to face them. "Nothing," she says, shaking her head. "I thought -you- saw something." She grisn good naturedly and leans against the hull again, resting one foot flat against the metal surface of the ship.

Skeezix shakes his head yet again. "Just thinking," he replies.

Lianna smirks at the strange situation, shaking her head, but yet exhales relived. She wan't actually looking forward to have to take that shuttle apart completely.

Altair lets her head rest against the cool metal of the ship's hull as a busy R2 unit hustles by, on its way to repair something or other on the ship. "Thinking what?" she asks curiously, lifting her head slightly and raising a quizzical brow at the general

Skeezix shakes his head, "Nothing, really." He turns back to Altair and simply says, "We haven't met, Captain, at least not formally."
