BLAH

==LOG STARTS==

Among a small group of latecomers to the race, comes Vauki, seemingly
disinterested with the random others he walks with. As the group fans out
into the crowds to find seats for themselves, Mege simply stops, peering
about the various people within eyesight of him.

Sargent takes her seat again, lowering herself to sit on the edge of the
folding apparatus. On her way down, she glances at the large viewscreens
above the track, checking the standings. With the glance, her expression
is as neutral as water, but not unpleasant. She folds her hands and places
them on her lap. Her ankles are crossed demurely under the seat. "I was
taking a break from business." Her voice is bright, but smooth. "One think
led to another," she says with a glance to the bruised and swollen ankle,
"and my break has extended somewhat."

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer dives onto to
repulsor pad with decent luck, being tossed into the third tube with quite
a bit of grace. The engine whines a bit as it complains to the racer but
the Firedancer continues to fly straight and true through this section,
screaming towards the next section.

From the Raceway -- "Ouch! Somebody is gonna need to pick up bit's'o'Kart
out there. Cause that look like it had ta hurt. How did she miss that?
Well that really hurt her speed as well, she only has 86 SRU's" He then
looks at the next scores "Simone in the Terminal Velocity has 218 SRU's
pulling 4 up on McTavish. She has a blistering pace going. Tarrin in the
avenger is moving along well with a 188 SRU's, and Howie in the Firdancer
has 131 SRU's. Both are behind in there current divisons."

Halloway gestures towards Altair's foot. "That doesn't bother me. I'll
just be sure to put it in a pocket that I don't normally stick my hand
into without thinking." He leans back and watches the race a bit. "I come
here because some of the boys in my old unit used to talk incessantly
about swoop racing. I'm stilly trying to figure some of it out. I miss
those guys. Speaking of which, you seem awfully young to be a colonel,
ma'am."

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer pulls her
speed back and settles the throttle into full thrust as she is going to
smart for a while from that nasty 'hit' in the previous section as she
heads once more for tube 2 of section 4, weaving her way among the
upthrusting towers of coral.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer looks to
brush up against one of the coral towers, but she continues on through the
track towards section 5.

From the Raceway -- As the oceanic scenery of Mon Calamari comes into
view, the Terminal Velocity gears towards tube three in overdrive, the
sleek black swoop charging forward towards the thickest of coral mazes.

From the Raceway -- Maybe the shortest path isn't always the fastest. The
Terminal Velocity has no trouble navigating the coral maze.. but to do it
without ripping the machine apart, the pilot has to weave through much
more coral than she originally intended, slowing her down significantly.

Altair smiles modestly. "Well, I'm a little older than I look, but I
really just happened to join at a really good time. The command structure
was weak and they really needed pilots. So when things started to
stablize, I got bumped up to fill empty spots. I was just lucky," she
says, finally finishing wiping the goop off her feet. "Thanks." She
gingerly folds the handkerchief up so that it is not too overtly gooey and
hands it back to him.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger roars quickly
out of the third jump tubes and makes his way towards the more difficult
portion of the track relizing that he is off the lead, and trying to pick
up just a bit more time.

Good. The old soldier and the pilot have found something to talk about.
Although Sargent is somewhat familiar with military theory, discussions
about military life are foreign to the young civilian, so she sits this
one out for now. She lets her eyes wander back toward the track, silently
gathering her thoughts. Occasionally, though, she does check up on the
progress of Captain Darklighter's swoop.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger makes his way
threw the dangerous coral with relitive speed to what he has run the rest
of the cource seeming unable to make any progress on the leaders.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer continues to
roar through the race track, leaving the bouncy Bespin course and enters
the coral filled Mon Calamari course. As the choice comes up, Howie
chooses the hardest tube yet again with it's engines full blast. Do or do
not, there is no try and apparently, Howie is trying with full ferocity,
trying to eat up the track that is located on his homeworld.

From the Raceway -- The coral filled tube is a difficult one to maneuver
in but apparently the racer of the Firedancer has quick hands as he has
not scene this race track before in his racing career. His engine returns
to being cooperative, giving him a good speed as he weaves about before
clearing the corals and heading right into the next section.

Halloway laughs ruefully. "That's a good way to say it. I'd say confusion
is perhaps more accurate. Maybe the folks in control now are just more
interested in pilots than old fashioned ground pounders. My whole regiment
was disbanded right after the Battle of Endor. Where are the New
Republic's forces now? Nowhere." Halloway shakes his head.

From the Raceway -- "Well, there're cooking with hyperdrive fuel now
folks! Well some of them are. It would seem Simone is saving some back for
later back at my pad....Yummie! She only has 280 SRU's justa little behind
the leaders pace. Tarrin in the Avenger is falling farther and farther
back from the grade 3 leader, he has 250 SRU's." Sighs "If Some body would
tell me the scores I could tell you how well Kartijan and her 105 SRU's
are in the grade 1 division. Howie has a 180 SRU's, and is just a little
infront of the leader of the Grade 2 division. I think, cause well I don't
know if I ahve all the numbers or not."

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer moves the
thrusters back into overdrive and manouvres her way to tube 1 as she
appears unprepared to risk the obstructions in the other two tubes, nor
their volcanic activity as she goes through section 5 of the track.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer ;'s rider
appears to have made a bad choice in moving back up to overdrive as the
engines give trouble again and the swoop fishtails into the side of the
tube leaving a trail of paint as sparks add to the light of this
lava-scape.

From the Raceway -- Worried about speed, the pilot of the Terminal
Velocity wastes no time heading right for the most dangerous part of the
track, the third tube containing her Lava Dragon.

From the Raceway -- Without hesitation, the racer zips through the
bubbling lava pits, avoiding any nasty confrontations with the giant Lava
Dragon creature and making up for lost time as best she can. The sleek
Terminal Velocity barrels forth through the heat, its finish shimmering
like a mirage on scalding pavement.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger pilot seems
diffently unhappy with the proformance of his swoop as he slams the
thoatal out of overdrive then back once more trying to get it to get some
more speed as he heads towards the dangerous third path.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger roars into the
tightly turning colcanic area quickly picking up speed as he diver though
the cavern with the Lava Dragon barely avoiding its attempts at him.

From the Raceway -- Perhaps the lava dragon that is spewing molten lava
out at the racers made Howie change his mind or he just steered wrong but
the Firedancer cruises right into the second tube at top speed, the engine
still rumbling at overdrive. The racer continues to lean down and forward,
hoping to enhance the aerodynamics of his swoop.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer roars through
the steam jetting volcanic peaks without any damage or hampering of speed,
his engine running at regular pace but it oculd do better. The pilot is
alive, the lava dragon no where near him and he quickly screams towards
the next objective, hoping to make a good time on this Corellian Track.

From the Raceway -- "WOW!! I guess the Terminal Velocity was just holding
back some, cause man she got her rear in gear that time. She now has 359
SRU's, and retakes the lead in the Grade 4 class. The avenger, now has
319, and isn't even close to the leader anymore. Firdancer, has fallen off
the lead in the grade 2 division with 219. Neutralizer has 138, course I'm
not sure how well she is doing..but then again, if she keeps bouncing
around the track like this we will never know how well she would have
done."

Sargent still looks out over the track. That she has little to add that
would stimulate this conversation does not bother her. Even with her
thoughts on work, she also listens to the conversation, appreciating the
value of their experiences. Now that the social situation in the stands
has stabilized, she settles in. Her impeccable posture just barely shifts
as she crosses her right leg over her left.

Halloway devolves into a low conversation on the finer points of military
organizations with COL Quina, effectively dropping the two of them out of
the conversations around them.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer holds the
throttle at overdrive in spite of the scrape in section 5 as she roars
through the Canyon under the artificial suns of section 6.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer moves easily
through the tube, between the cliffs and heads on to section 7.

From the Raceway -- The flat desert sands of Beggar's Canyon are a simple
obstacle, in comparison to the dangers of a lava dragon and molten pools
of magma exploding in sprays and bursts that could scald or even kill a
racer.. not to say much for what it'd do to the paint finish on a swoop.
The Terminal Velocity leaves the swoop in high gear, but the pilot can be
seen relaxing more now than before.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Terminal Velocity coasts
along through the winding valley, keeping up a decent speed and having no
trouble at all with the difficult twists and turns presented. The howls of
the sand people don't seem to bother her much, and the frigid blasts of
air coming off the seventh section of the track are welcomed.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger pilot curses
himself as he keeps his swoop into the over drive setting trying to make
up as much time as he can knowing it isn't likely he will catch the
leaders now but..

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger makes his want
threw the canyons but seems to be slowing ever more, looks like maybe he
pushed the swoop to hard and is paying for it now.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer continues to
hit overdrive in his swoop as the easy flat desert plains appear. The heat
isn't too bad since it's only generated and there are basically no
obstacles in front to slow or hurt the swoopers. The shrieks and cries of
banthas or Sand People doesn't distract the racer, perhaps the Firedancer
drowns out the other noise.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer cruises right
through the replicated desert but the engine seems to be not up to par
right now, doing below average for now. Perhaps the swoop is saving some
of its juices for last. Atleast that's what Howie is hoping for as the
racer races right into the next section without any harm from this
section.

From the Raceway -- "Wow!! Back and fourth Simone and Troy battle it would
seem. Simone has just fallen a little back of McTavish's pace. Its gonna
come right to the finish with those two, Simone has 428 SRU's!!!" He then
carries on forgetting to insult as the race gets closer and closer to
being finalized. "Tarrin is drivinga good race, but just isn't up to the
calibier this day of Kieri of the Privateers. He has 370 SRU's. Kartijan
has 174 SRU's and has finaly stablized her crashing ways. Howie, has
fallen even a little farther back of the grade 2 leader. Can he make up
the difference with only 2 sections left. He has 257 SRU's"

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer moves into
the frigid section 7, maintaining her thrusters at overdrive and heading
into the wide tube 1.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer soars over
the snowdrifts as she moves ahead and into the final section of the track.

From the Raceway -- It isn't a difficult choice for the Terminal
Velocity's pilot- tube three is chosen, and the black swoop darts
dangerously into the caverns where the live Wampa lives.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Terminal Velocity coasts
through the icy caverns, dodging the stalagtites and stalagmites, and
avoiding wherever the live Wampa has chosen to hide for this portion of
the race. The crispness of the air causes a misty sheen across her helmet
visor that quickly dissipates as she heads forth for the last section of
the track, the more tepid waters of the Anoat sewers.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger pilot seems to
kick the side of his swoop as he shifts her back into overdrive and turns
dirrectly for the most difficult of all the tunnels, not seeming to be
concerned for his safety just upset at his slow run.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger rockes quickly
thoure the area darting through the narrow windy area with seemingly ease
as one of the wampa suddently slashes out driving its claws deeply into
Tarrin's shoulder splaying blood every almost causing the rider to be
thrown from the swoop.

From the Raceway -- Hoth... the racer of the Firedancer, Howie, has been
there, yes. The stay wasn't too nice and this section proves to be the
same as the snowy atmosphere doesn't help with the racing conditions. The
racer dives right into the second tube once again, not wanting to screw up
at this point so he chooses the second tube that doesn't slow him down too
much but gives him a greater chance to succeed. He guns the engine into
overdrive again to give him as much speed as possible.

Vauki, still standing watches the horror, and blinks at the Wampa's
outlashing. He wanders over to one of the screens to watch.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer roars through
the Hoth scene without much trouble but his engine is still muffled a bit,
giving him a slower boost than what he wished for. "Dammit... comon
dancer, stay with me here, we're almost there." The pilot urges the swoop
on and dives right into the next section.

From the Raceway -- "Holly frozen snot drops from a Wampa, Simone and
McTavish are tied going into the final section. Simone has 503, SRU's and
guess what for you really slow folks So did McTavish. Howie in the
Firedancer has 304 SRU's falling a little further behind the leader of the
Grade 2 section. Can he make up the difference in the last section? Who
the hell knows. Tarrin, seems to be now driving a little bit more recklace
and a little less skilled and Ewww a little more bloddy as he falls even
farther back from Kieri the leader of the Grade 3 section. Kartijan has
207 SRU's and seems to be groving well, can she manage the last section
and possibly grab first place?"

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer slips into
tube 1 of this final section at overdrive, leaning tight to the machine
after hitting a couple of buttons then revving the engine in a manner
similar to that of the last section.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Neutralizer splashing
the murky brown water to either side as she swoops low overhead, rushing
through the long tube and around to the finish line.

The Dianoga's path is chosen, the second tube, and the Terminal Velocity
heads pel-mel down the track as fast as it can go, throttle all the way
open in overdrive and the pilot hankered down over the handlebars, fingers
white beneath her gloves from holding on tightly to the steering grips.

From the Raceway -- The giant eye-stalk of the Dianoga appears on the
jumbo-tron and the tentacles bulge up from the murky recesses of its
habitat, though try as it might, it can't get a tentacle on the Terminal
Velocity. The black Avalon swoop shoots forward without any impedements
and heads for the finish line.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger pilot tries to
hold on, the swoop continuing in over drive as he makes for the harder of
the two sections of the track, it is hard to tell if he is going for time
now or just trying to get to the finishline so he can get to the medics at
this point

Kestryan stands up in his reserve box as Kart crosses the finish line. He
turns and heads out of the stands, not sure whether to be happy or upset
by her victory.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger rockes though
the narrow yet quick tunnet and makes it past the Dianoga and across the
finishline, as he slides to a stop the rider slumps forward across the
contoll system of the swoop....

From the Raceway -- The final showdown, the last segment. If the
Firedancer racer wants to have a shot at the first place spot, he knows
that he needs a spectacular ending. This is it Howie tells himself as he
approaches the last round. He chooses the narrow debris filled tunnel,
tube two with the tentacle creature venturing. He kicks it into overdrive,
yes, overdrive.  Hell come out of the tube in one form or another. A
champion or a dead pilot, this is it. The Firedancer screams into the
narrow tube, his future ahead of him.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Firedancer screams
through the last segment of the course straight and true, a truely heroic
maneuver as he evades everything in the narrow tunnel, speeding to his
goal, the finish line. As he passes the different creatures and debris, he
shuts his eyes at the end, the exit of the tube as he passes the finish
line, cutting the engine at the end and praying for a victory run. The
final moment is about to arrive as the announcement is about to be made.

From the Raceway -- "WOW!" he seems to say that alot "That was a close
finish all the way around. Kartijan racing for Team FLS in the Neutralizer
finished with 241 SRU's. Then we have Howie racing in the Firedancer, and
team Corellia has 374 SRU's just short of first place. Next is Tarrin,
racing in the Avenger for...ahh hell I forget. He finishes strong but out
of first place with 515 SRU's. Next but certainly not least is Simone in
the Terminal veloctiy, she finishes.....Just short of McTavish's time with
a 599 SRU's."

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Avenger rider pushes
himself up once more and tries to get the swoop off the track.

From the Raceway -- As the announcement comes through, Howie hears that he
is in second place, short of first. He's getting closer and closer to what
he is aiming for however, finishing fourth in the last race. He rises from
his swoop as it is quietly idling now and pulls his racing helmet off,
revealing a perspiration drenched face. He gives the crowd a proud grin
and a wave before escorting his swoop off of the tracks.
