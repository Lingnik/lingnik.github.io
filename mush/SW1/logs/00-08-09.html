People Involved: Bazil, Enb'Zik

==LOG BEGINS==


Night has fallen on this side of the sparkling city-planet, and the orb's
lights scintillate from Imperial City out into the depths of the system's
surrounding space. Somewhere within that city, Enb'Zik quietly sits by
himself and nurses a juri daiquiri that easily blends with the choices of
the Republic officers and other guests around the room. Casually, the
Sullustan observes others while appearing to handle some type of business
with a small, nondescript datapad that's tipped upward on the table in
front of him.

And in through the doors of the club comes Bazil, a little frattered and
worn, having just arrived from Tatooine, pushing the engines the whole
time. But, that's quite alright, in his view. Anything to get some more
intelligence business going.  And with everything going on nowadays, he
definately appreciates that. Trussed in his worn civvies, he walks slowly
through the various beings in the area, spotting his target at the bar.
His feet take him rather swiftly towards it, and he offers a short "Hey,
Zik." when he reaches the Sullustan.

"Evening, Bazil. Thanks for coming on the short notice." The Sullustan
takes a sip of his drink and sets it on the counter, switching the data
pad off and tucking the slimline device into a pocket on the front of his
shirt. "I trust your journey here went more safely than ours two nights
ago?" He chuckles lightly in remembrance.

"Quite safer... but I'd rather not talk about my journey... classified
stuff, ya know? But, in any case..." Bazil starts, sliding into a bar
stool next to the Sullustan, "What's up?" Now, either Bazil doesn't care
that he's in the middle of the most public and popular nightclub on
Coruscant, or he's hoping for some sort of teaser before taking the
business to a more quiet locale.

Enb'Zik was thinking identically. Having already looked about the room, he
determined over an hour ago that this wasn't the best place for such a
discussion as he was hoping to have. "Little, really. Been scoping out a
few used spaceship lots in hopes of catching a good bargain. After our
encounter the other evening, I was hoping you might be able to point me in
the direction of a reputable dealer." A slight grin tugs at the
Sullustan's lip beneath his jowls as he motions sideways toward the vials
of drinks lined up opposite the bar, "Choose your poison if you don't mind
showing me around. I'll buy."

Nodding, Bazil grins softly, and offers, "I'm sure I could hook you up
with CEC. They've got some good deals on their smaller scout ships this
month, I do believe..." He lifts a hand, and waves the barkeep over. A
younger man wanders over, currently in the process of drying a glass.
"Gimme some Corellian Whiskey. Any vintage'll do." Comes the order from
the intel officer, before he cocks his head back over to Zik, inquiringly.

Enb'Zik pushes his glass forward and meets the tender's gaze, "Just top
mine off with what I've got and take the creds from my account. I gave the
number to your compatriot." He motions politely to a second keep on down
the bar and gets a nod in return. Giving his attention back to Bazil,
Enb'Zik picks up the conversation while the young man turns away, "Depends
on your definition of scouting. Actually, I had something a little racier
in mind. Need something fast with a good set of eyes on her."

Nodding slightly with more interest, Bazil awaits his glass, "Aye... I
see. Maybe a corvette, or something smaller? Get you in and out of
somewhere really quick, nice hyperdrive... good weapons, 'case you get
into a fight. Great sensor package and computer systems?" Baz lifts a
solitary hand up to rub the back of his neck slowly. Going from scathing
temperatures on Tatooine to the chilled night air here is definately bound
to cause some discomfort.

Enb'Zik bites his lip in thought as the waiter speedily returns with the
two drinks. The Sullustan reaches into a pocket and lays a pair of
five-cred chips on the counter for the human. "Thanks, Zoch," he offers,
using a bit of friendly, Sullustan vernacular that the tender seems to
appreciate. Nodding finally to Bazil, he slips from the hoverstool and
stands up, "Actually, I've got a picture of what I'm looking for back on
my ship if you feel like coming." Zik is reasonably sure that Bazil still
has his commlink transmitting, so both parties know there isn't any risk
of the Sullustan trying anything stupid. "Or if you know a place that
sells snubs, perhaps I can point something out on the lot."

"Sounds good," Bazil offers, sliding off his own stool, and smoothly
lifting his own glass up, "Let's take a look at your picture. I'm sure
it'll be more accurate... who knows what kinds of guns and sensors'd be
added, if you just point one out to me." He shrugs, and lifts his glass up
to his mouth, taking a slow sip, his eyes never leaving the other.

"Sounds great," Zik replies, "You can meet my wife while we're there.
Wonderful lady." Grinning amicably, he turns and begins wading through the
crowd on his way toward the door. "It's funny," he remarks, "This place
was a lot quieter earlier in the day. Coruscant has an interesting night
life."

"Well, they don't call it a nightclub for nothin, ya know." Bazil offers,
grinning slightly, as he weaves in and out of the crowds, barely avoiding
a collision with a tiny server droid. Why was it that Republic
Intelligence never communicated in such variable ways, masking their
conversations as something else? Never, not once, had he went into
conversation like that without it having been fabricated in some classroom
who knows how many years ago. Maybe it was the formality that still
existed, even with the NRI being so free. The kind of formality that kept
things simple, but that also took the excitement and fun out of the job...
that was the kind of thing Bazil always enjoyed, but to do such in front
of his agents would look bad to his superiors. Definately the reason he
had been planning on a hiatus from his work for a couple months, after the
whole Death Star fiasco ended. If it ever ended.

Enb'Zik laughs as he reaches the door. Pausing inside while it slides
open, he glances back toward the human, "I suppose you have a point!" Zik
steps back as a pair of Ithorians step through the door, and then he uses
the same route to move out of the building and onto the somewhat less
populated street.

As the pair exit the club, the atmosphere goes from noisy and lighted to
dark and calm. Only light traffic goes here and there through the area,
and even fewer pedestrians. Waiting for them to get a ways away from the
nightclub's entrance, Bazil ponders to himself some more over the secret
conversation style, before flipping over into a normal frame of mind...
"So...  your wife informed you of my offer, I take it?" It's only so
plainly obvious, of course, but the intel officer /does/ need to make
sure, before he goes and blunders this up, too.

Interesting. Enb'Zik looks sideways toward Bazil and appears curious for a
moment before answering, "No, she must not have."  More businesslike now,
he keeps his eyes on Bazil as he awaits more information, "After last
night, she spent most of the day resting aboard the Mutan. We haven't had
much opportunity to speak with one another, I'm afraid." The walk takes a
casual speed as the two meander eastward in no particular hurry.

Very interesting indeed. So why was he called so urgently to the planet?
Bazil ponders lightly, "So, what is it that you called me here for?"
Peering over to the other inquisitively, he wonders to himself... does
this man have some sort of offer for /him/?

Enb'Zik laughs quietly, "I told you. I'm looking for a ship." He pauses
before adding, "And a way to help make sure my home planet stays safe." He
pauses again, "And a little something to do between races." The Sullustan
smiles easily, "Tell me, though. What did you and Snal'Fashtalli speak
about? I'm honestly curious."

"A job, so to speak. She informed me that she is... not quite happy with
her current form of employment. Too much in the way of formalistic rules
and regulations. Said she preferred not so much of that..." Bazil offers,
before biting his lip. This could be interesting. "So... I offered
her--and you--work... my branch occasionally hires out freelance
operatives... and so..."

Enb'Zik seems pleased as his smile tightens beneath his pale flews. He
nods; this certainly makes his request a lot easier.  As the two continue
down the glideway, Enb'Zik continues to question the human, "What kind of
work do you have in mind?"  Above the two men, the starfield seems to be
alive with as many pinpoints of light moving as there are stationary ones.

Shrugging softly, Bazil continues, "Oh... just a few jobs here and there,
whenever we need someone that isn't connected to the Republic... grab a
little info here, work with our agents there... a little black ops here
and there." He shrugs, "Pretty much everything our agents do, but for more
pay, 'less ya don't want the money." A sly grin.

Enb'Zik laughs quietly as the two continue moving, but he nods, "That's a
little different from what I had in mind, but it can be done, I think."
Taking his eyes from the street, Zik looks over at other man, "I'm a
pilot, Bazil. Most members of my race are, but some of us are better than
others." The shorter of the two turns his gaze forward again, "Let's
see... if I had to guess, I would say Rogue Squadron is in orbit right now
with the Deliverance. I saw one of your A-wings at the spaceport, probably
an Archer, so the chances are that they're on Coruscant right now, too.
And.. I met Colonel Quila of the Ghosts at the spaceport this morning, as
well." Enb'Zik takes a breath and lets it out slowly, "The New Republic's
three best squadrons. I could be wrong, but something tells me the New
Republic would appreciate some extra help monitoring Imperial fleet
movements."

Well, it's not the idea he was thinking, but it's a nice one, nonetheless.
With the recent Death Star taking up most of Intel's work, they had lost
track of most of the fleet movements--excluding the massive one at Dreven.
"Aye, and you'd be right on all counts."

Enb'Zik walks several steps after McKenzie speaks, letting silence reign
for awhile. Only the sounds of ship traffic a the spaceport, soft
conversations between midnight romancers, and a quiet breeze pervade the
lack of sound before the Sullustan speaks up, "Mind if I ask where you're
from, Bazil? Originally?"

A wince comes forth from Bazil, and a single corner of his mouth tenses
tightly, "Tatooine. Or at least... an asteroid in the Tatooine system.
Mining asteroid, to put a point on it. A little place, run by a guy called
McKenzie, and operated by slaves. Including me, for who knows how many
years, 'fore I escaped to Tatooine itself." Hie brows furrow slightly,
remembering the thoughts that have drawn him down into despair for so very
long. The same thoughts that nearly kept him out of Diplo, and Intel.

Enb'Zik pauses and walks quietly for a bit. "I understand," he answers
quietly. "I was never burdened with that type of slavery, but my own
planet went through a similar experience that was just as oppressive.
SoroSuub took over our government and handed us right over to the Empire.
The Imperials squeezed my family hard. We were too political, too
outspoken.." Zik considers his words and shakes his head, "It's hard to
explain, and I know there isn't really any way to make it compare to what
it was probably like on Tatooine, but the bottom line is this -- there's a
Death Star floating around up there somewhere, and I don't want it blowing
up my home. Nor do I have any desire for the Imperials to maintain any
edge in the balance of power that currently exists. You let me know what I
can do to help, and I'll do it."

Finally, possibly, someone who /can/ help. "I don't know what you can
do... the Empire has closed off most of their systems to /anyone/...
anyone going near Dreven is firmly told to get out, or die. Might be
because that's where the Death Star is, but who know... maybe Valak is
tired of sightseers in his palace. I can tell you want would be useful,
however... we know the next target of the Death Star, we know where it is.
What we don't know much of is everything else. We think the Emperor Valak
and a quite a number of other flagships are at Dreven... we think some are
at Selene, for only the force knows why."  He shrugs softly, pondering to
himself lightly. Fleet movements from the Empire were getting scarcer
lately. Why, was anyone's best guess. "You may find this strange... but I
never heard of either the Empire, nor the Republic, until just a short
time before I joined up as a pilot for Ghost... it sounds insane, but my
employment never took me into hostile waters, so to speak. I was happy
with my little freighter, and my routes from Caspar. It's times like this
that make me wish I had still never heard of the Republic. But ya' know...
I have made so many friends, that I don't think I could ever leave them
for good. I don't want them dead, just as much as I'm sure you don't want
your family dead. I don't have any more real family anymore. The Republic
is my family... my fellow pilots, and everyone else I've gotten to
know..."

Enb'Zik listens carefully to every bit of what he's told as several key
pieces of information fall into place for him. The Sullustan folds his
arms against his chest in response to the relative cold of the Coruscanti
night. "The military can be a tightly knit group at times," he concedes.
"Dreven and Selene. Hmmm.. So what's your call regarding their next
target? You said you're certain of the location?"

"As certain as we can be. With Valak, nowadays, we don't really know
anything for sure. But, evacuation preperations have already been started.
Any fool with a friend in the Senate could tell you that, now. As long as
the Empire keeps to their plan, we know where, we just don't know when."
Bazil shrugs softly, "I dunno why they're keeping Selene so tight, though
I could find out, if I really wanted to."

Enb'Zik stops in the middle of the walkway and turns to face Bazil
squarely. "I'm afraid that living on Caspar doesn't leave me with many
contacts inside the Republic Senate, Bazil. Which system are they after,
and how can I assist? Let me know that; my price is small for a group with
the Republic's means."

"Ithor," Bazil says, simply, his own steps halted, as he peers down at the
ground beneath him. Slowly, he turns his gaze up to Zik, and offers it
again, "The target is Ithor. I don't know what you can do to help with
that... in all honesty. I don't know what any of us can do but get the
Ithorians out, and watch the planet smoulder when we return." He sighs,
and shakes his head, turning his head down yet again, "In these dark days,
I just wish that we could find the plans and take her out right now. I was
a slave during the last two stations, but I've heard the tales over and
over again, of how they were destroyed. If only the force could give us a
little push in the right direction..." He falters in his speaking, and
just stops there, shaking his head--at himself, more than anything. It's
Intel's job to get that information, but so far, they've come up empty
handed. Hell, they didn't even find out the third reincarnation existed
until it blew up Gastus in front of Bazil's own face, while he was having
fun aboard the Angry Rancor.

Enb'Zik's eyes widen before he blinks and stands silently, dumbstruck. The
Sullustan glances skyward, his eyes tracing through the moving pinpoints
of ships until they come to rest on a solitary point of yellow-white
light, the Ithorian sun, and a bluish star only inches away in the
starfield, "Ithor is only... minutes from Sullust with a fast hyperdrive."
Zik shivers quietly in the night air, only able to imagine the sight of a
planet being obliterated by one, massive laser.  Moments pass before he
speaks again, "I need a ship, Bazil. I'd prefer an unmarked, used A-Wing.
I'll help pay for it myself, and there are some pretty specific upgrades
I'd like to have made on it, but if you can pull some strings to help me
get the vessel, I'd appreciate it. Name your typical pay for contracted
work, and.. I have one other favor that I think you could help with. You'd
at least have the right connections. If you can pull those things off,
I'll give you the best help I've got in taking that monster out."

The intelligence officer listens through it all solemnly, continuing his
gaze upon the ground, "We usually pay per assignment, for contract work.
All depends on what the job calls for... high risk jobs get more, low risk
jobs get less...  you know. As for the ship... I'm sure I could procure
one. It may take some work... but my position gives me power over such
things. I'll try my damnedest." Consulting his memory on various items,
Bazil ponders vaguely, before peering back up, "What's the favor?"

Enb'Zik looks at Bazil unwaveringly, "I want to fly with your men when
they make their final assault on the Death Star."  Enb'Zik's eyes show
nothing but complete determination, and he seems prepared to defend his
request, "Check my background if you need to. I'm clean, and I'm good.
I've even worked briefly with New Republic diplomacy while I was in the
Sullustan Diplomatic Corps. I've got a seven-plus SFP rating, a six-plus
gunnery rating, -and- I've flown missions for Caspar's Elite 17th Squadron
that I couldn't even begin to discuss with you."

"Oh... I don't doubt your skill. I've looked into some of your
background... you're good. Problem is, the Republic is facing tensions
with Caspar right now. I don't know whether my people would trust you.
Force knows I do... after this long in Intel, you learn to spot a
phoney..." Bazil looks down again, and crosses his arms at his chest,
"Tell you what: you give me a day to see if I can even find you an A-Wing,
and talk to a very good friend of mine, of whom I think you know
already...  Colonel Quila was my CO when I flew with Ghost Squadron way
back when. She and I are pretty good friends, and I'll see what she thinks
about all this. If worst comes to worst, I'll just have my slicers make
you a New Republic citizen of ten years, and pilot on the outer ring
territories, recently transferred into active status with the
Deliverance." He shrugs, "I can't make any guarantees until I talk with my
contacts about the ship, and to Altair about flying... but... I assure
you, you've got a damned good chance of it happening."

Enb'Zik keeps his eyes on those of the human while Bazil replies. The
Sullustan knows he has a good bet with Altair, and he can't see why the
Republic would be unwilling to part with a used starfighter. Finding
Bazil's offer acceptable, Enb'Zik reaches out a hand, "Then we agree." He
smiles finally, "Bazil, I look forward to helping the Republic. I've been
thinking about this for far too long."

Bazil extends his own hand towards Zik's, clasping and shaking firmly, "I
look forward to working with you, Zik. I just hope that I can get you what
you want. With everything that has gone on of late... I can't be sure of
anything anymore. But I have faith, that if anyone can get that A-Wing,
it's Altair. Now... I must return from whence I came... with a short
rendevoux with the Deliverance to talk with the colonel. I will contact
you in thirty-six hours. Farewell for now."

Enb'Zik nods and takes a step back, "Save journey, Bazil. I'll be close to
the Mutan over at the starport. I'll see you when you have news, and let
me know if I can otherwise be of assistance." As they finish shaking,
Enb'Zik withdraws his hand and prepares to head back to his shuttle.

And as for Bazil... he disappears into the shadows of the streets, masking
himself into the darkness, headed for some unknown destination. He hopes
dearly that he can get the two requests approved... ships are short
nowadays, but he's right.  If anyone can do it, Altair can. With her rank,
and friendship with the higher-ups, she could probably procure a cruiser
if need be. And, if Altair can't get it, he knows far enough others to try
again... and he will. If anyone would have been watching with keen
interest, they might notice a solitary unmarked YT-1300 drift lazily up
into the skies of the night, and depart to somewhere...
