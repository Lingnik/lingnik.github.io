Players Involved: Jonau Diggs, Ernie

Synopsis: 

Background: 

==LOG BEGINS==

Pallando follows Josh out of the CCS Merganaui. He seems a little more
worn than when he entered.

Jonau is now seated upon a bench, a lit cigar plopped into his maw, a book
on his lap. He seems intent in studying the words upon it, smiles playing
over his face occasionally, mixed with frowns, and other sources of
emotion. The lights above give just enough light for him to adequately
read.

Pallando branches off from Josh as the latter heads for his A wing and the
latter heads back toward the Fate's Gambit. It seems in his absence the
several swoops have been stuffed in the small gnat and the loader and tech
crews departed.  The Sarian rubs the back of his neck giving partign
glance to the dive tavern here at Coronet City's port. Glancing away his
countenence and gase take in the erascible Mr Diggs. His expression smiles
in Irony.

Completely benign and unaware of anything that happened around him in the
starport the past minutes. He doesn't even appear to notice the Sarian
man, as he starts a hearty chuckle, sending smoke spewing out his
nostrils, trailing up into the light above him, causing an eerie glow to
froth around him. Totally engrossed in his book, one of his few pleasures,
the intelligence officer delves as deep as possible as he can out of his
life.

Pallando bites his lip with an entertainging thought. He fades around
making circuitous route to come upon Biggs from behind. He takes advantage
of the natural populated thurough fares and the crates of un loaded
materials in his efforts t oclose unseen on the man.

Once behind him it seems a shame to not take better advantage of it but he
only taps the man on the shoulder as if to starle him, "Captain Diggs. You
souhld be more careful. Much riff raff is in system for the races.
Exposure to the Space Port fumes for too long could be grave danger to
one's health." He cautions.

It certainly takes much more than a tap on the shoulder to startle the
poor old man. But he is surprised, even depite the fact that he doesn't
show it. He continues to seemingly read through his book, blowing out
another puff of smoke, which happens to envelope up around him, before
dissipating up into the skies. Without even turning to look, he offers,
"Good evening Mr. Pallando. My health is long gone from me. I'm an old
man. I don't much care whether or not a trivial risk will drag me into the
afterlife. I have lived long... longer than I might have expected thirty
years ago. I simply await my time, now, and pace my days."

Pallando smiles expecting no less than rank sarcasm from a beaurucratic
servent of the beheamouth. "Then I'll not waste the breath on one thats
half in the grave all ready. Enjoy your trip to Caspar. Will you be
brigning Land owith you or just his clean vessel?" The Commodore gives
glance to it but is still behind the man so he might not notice the
gesture.

The old man takes a long draw from his cigar, closing his eyes as if to
enjoy the last seconds of his life. He smiles, before letting his mouth
open to release the cloud of smoke. Slowly, he closes the book in his lap,
keeping a solitary finger within it. "I'll be returning to the Deliverance
to drop off some things, and such. Most likely with Calrissian." He peers
up behind him, offering a slight smile, not a single speck of light
hinting to sarcasm, "Come now, Mr. Pallando, you didn't come all the way
out here just to frighten an old man, did you?"

Pallando gives look to Arands A Wing, "Mostly. But the part thats lesser
was to meet you before we were to be thrown together by circumstance. Its
been a long time since I worked on an intel mission and just like to know
who's suppsoedly watching my backside before I show it to them."

"Ahh, I see." Jonau pulls the cigar from his maw, letting it dance in the
air above the ground, the ashes falling to the ground slowly, drifting
with the nearly nonexistant winds, like some sort of miniature parachute
is attached to each individual flake. Under the dim light, it's easy to
see how old the man is, in his entirety. Nearing 55... and still ticking.  
Has it really been that long, he wonders to himself? Almost thirty-seven
years of service to the same damned people, and all he's gotten out of it,
really, was a pension. A nice pension, granted, but it's still the only
thing he'll get, besides the death sentence if he talks about what he did
in his job.

Pallando tries to restrain show of mirth at the mans complete lack of
small talk with lines to be read between or not seems almost a joke in and
of itself. "I better get your acting Ambasador back home, before she is
missed. I'd hate to be the cause of ggetting her into trouble. I'll see
you at the Embasy Captain in two days. We'll talk more then. Till then. I
sincerly hope you keep the other half out of the grave your digging
there."

Grinning suddenly, Diggs nods in response. He has always been a man of
few--and select--words. "Of course, Mr.  Pallando. I will see you there.
Have a safe trip, and watch out for stray Death Stars." The words, while
joking, are kept simple. He already considers the conversation ended, as
he pries the book back open, and delves himself back in, taking another
draw from the cigar.

Palando pushes off the bench he was leaning on and moves around infront of
it showing his unprotected backside to the man perhaps as show of respect
maybe trust or maybe insult. He keeps walking toward the samll Gnat Fates
gambit.

After a few moments of the walking away, Diggs flashes his eyes up for an
instant, just to observe the man. If the man had it out for him, he'd be
dead by now. Was the person who was sneaking up on him earlier that very
man? No... it couldn't have been. Could it? No matter, now. It seems Diggs
has some sort of mission on his hands, with the person he'd least like to
work with right now. Service and duty? Bah.
