<p>cockpit sits at the front, and twin engine pods take up the aft section. The body of the freighter bubbles out along the sides between the cargo pods in front and the engines to the rear, giving this vessel a more interesting and cleaner look, further accented with clean transitions and lines. It is painted semi-gloss black except for the underbelly, which is painted sky blue. Emblazoned in italic along the sides the ship is the name of NRS INTERNUNCIO, which stands out in blood-red, outlined in gold, against the sleek black backdrop. A small trademark just below the name states that this ship was built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.</p>
<p>A Nestt freighter drifts into the bay slowly, her engines softly glowing against the light of the area. With marked determination, she comes about, near one of the spare walls, and sets down, a tiny bit of dust from the area around her blowing up as the antigrav shuts down from under her. A soft clinking sound is ushered forth from her, as the entrance ramp unlocks and lowers down to the ground with a soft hiss of decompression. Gases spray out of several exhaust nozzles around the entrance, giving it a mysterious look to it. After a few moments, a single person steps out, first noticable by his impecable uniform, and finally stepping out of the way of the gases, revealing Bazil's face. He pauses at the base of it for a few seconds, folding his hands in each other behind his back.</p>
<p>A totally transformed light freighter, this ship speaks to comfort, style, and luxury. It is 29 meters long and appears to be quite a sturdy vessel. It resembles a pair of long cargo pods connected along a central axis. A triangular cockpit sits at the front, and twin engine pods take up the aft section. The body of the freighter bubbles out along the sides between the cargo pods in front and the engines to the rear, giving this vessel a more interesting and cleaner look, further accented with clean transitions and lines. It is painted semi-gloss black except for the underbelly, which is painted sky blue. Emblazoned in italic along the sides the ship is the name of NRS INTERNUNCIO, which stands out in blood-red, outlined in gold, against the sleek black backdrop. A small trademark just below the name states that this ship was built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.</p>
<p>Lianna is a tall, slender almost lanky human woman of a bit short of 1,80 meters height. The icy aura of her whitish, pale skin is increased by her short cut hair, about three finger's width in length, dyed silver and that stands up a bit disorderly in a hedgedog-style. Her face is longish and the paleness only broken by her ice blue eyes, framed by just a touch of black eyeliner, and her faintly light red lips. Her nose is small and roundish, again adding to the impression that her face contours are vanishing, leaving her eyes and hair to be the only features that really stick out.</p>
<p>She seems slightly nervous theese days. Her eyes follow those movements around her more obviously, although she looks tired. However she has become even more quiet then usally, speaking only when adressed or she feels like it directly concerns her most of the time.</p>
<p>Currently Lianna is wearing a loose fitting dark blue jumpsuit, that is padded on the knees to protect them when kneeing to access parts and is tucked over black boots, heavy and with a thick rubber-sole, that give her good traction and standing on mettallic survaces like the fuselage of an X-wing and the durasteel plating of the hangarbay as well. Over that jumpsuit she wears a dark blue utility vest, providing her with many pockets, that she utilises to store small screws, wires, energy cells and what not. That vest bears a removeable name tag as well: Blackledge, Sergeant, Support Ops. A utility belt houses most of the common tools, a fusion cutter, hydrospanner and power Calibrator are among them as well as screwdrivers for fine manipulation and a two small glowrods, one tightbeam and one straylight.</p>

<p>Supposed to take it slow and easy, Lianna had yet sneaked her way down to the hangar to 'check on things'. If Jasmine finds her down here, she propably let Geroam confine her in her quarters for disobeying her orders. But she IS doing less then she used to do. Standing in one of the corners of the hangar, she is talking with a female technician, smiling weakly at the young crew meber. At her age, she didn't like the idea of going out in Zero-G suits neither. "It is part of the training, and you need to complete it is all I can say to it. Tis time you won't fail the test, and you will get the permission. Adn then you will assist me in the next work out there. There's no arguing about that.", the tech just sighs, and whatever she replies is drowned out by the nearby ship landing and causing dust to rise and force both to turn away.</p>
<p>With an all too calm look, Bazil stands at the base of the ship for a few more moments, looking about. He softly contorts his head to the sides, popping at the neck. Frowning momentarily, he pulls a small datapad from some pocket, and taps at it lightly, not looking up again. Standing there like that, he must look quite odd to anyone who is watching; him being completely alone there, standing erect, with a solitary datapad resting in his palms.</p>
<p>Lianna shakes her head at the pilot, looking back at the tech. "Where were we? Oh yeah...I told you the last time, and I tell you again, there's no way around that, and I couldn't care less about what they told you. You need the training. And you cannot work on my crew without it. Period.", she says, still smiling, but letting shine through that her recent absence has nothing to do let people hope her decisions are to challanged. Even if she seems much more calmer then before she left. Most even say freightening calm. "Dismissed.".</p>
<p>Finally, Bazil sets the datapad aside, tapping it closed, and slipping it into a pocket. His eyes glance up, and he reaches the now-free hand up to his head, adjusting a misplaced strand of hair back into place. A slight sigh rolls out of his mouth, as he looks about. 'Finally...' he thinks to himself, as a pair of male technicians step up to him, the younger of them a tad nervous around the uniformed man. Bazil speaks with them for a few moments, before waving a hand towards the freighter lying behind him, which rests in absolute silence now. Eventually, the techs withdraw, heading over to the ship to make a first glance over it.</p>
<p>Bazil, now free of that duty, yet again releases another sigh. With a slowed step, he begins pressing forward across the bay for about ten meters, and stops at a pile of crates. He pushes a single palm upon one of them, looking about the area again, his eyes finally resting upon a collection of X-Wings near the wall. His eyes remain there, almost unfocused, his mind wading through memories.</p>
<p>With the tech moving away, Lianna chuckles faintly, but careful to not be heared by the grumbling tech. She reminds her of herself. She had to take the zero-G training three times. And she hated it! Moving over towards the crates herself, she whips out her datapad, then her comlink. "The shield generator circuits already arived? I haven't them catalouged....No, I will make it myself.", she says, shuting the comlink off again and looks up, first at the pilot, then at the crates he leans on. "Excuse me...", she says, pointing at the label Bazil is standing in front of.</p>
<p>For a moment, the pilot doesn't even realize he's being spoken to. He continues to stare off in the direction for a moment, before he finally realizes it was really /him/ that the woman was talking to. With a jump, Bazil turns swiftly, his eyes tracing towards the label on the crate... "Oh, I'm sorry about that." He replies, cooly regaining his calmness. He moves away from the crate a foot, in order to let the technician get at it. Looking her over minimally, his eyes hint the tiniest bit of recognition.</p>
<p>If Lianna recognizes the pilot, espeically in the new outfit, she shows no hinto of it. Handling the stylus of the datapad, checking the labels on the crates with the ones on the list, she logs their arrival. Standard work. Technical parts today. It takes awhile she is through all the crates, and with a few additional tappings of the stylus, the pad beeps, and Lianna shuts it of, storing it back into the little puch on her belt. A few lifter droids already begin to move in on the supplies. "Thank you.", she says, not giving the pilot half a thought right now.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, M'am..." Bazil starts softly, inquisitively, "But would you happen to know how long it might take for a routine diagnostics run-over of a freighter that size?" His hand, by this time, has already waved towards the Nestt. The two technicians seeming to be running some sort of scanning equipment over her hull. Bazil smiles softly, a strange gesture for him.</p>
<p>Lianna stops, glancing at the freighter, then at the pilot. "Depends if we find something I guess.", she says, matter of factly. She frowns slightly. "What's the name?", she queries, taking out her datapad again. Let's see what the papers about that ship say...</p>
<p>"The NRS Internuncio," Bazil starts off, as he slowly assumes his straigt position, clasping his hands behind his back. "A very new ship. Received only yesterday." he adds, and then stops. He gives himself a small sigh, barely audible.</p>
<p>Lianna hmms slightly. "Yeah, I see that.", she says, as the data comes up. "So the first inspection? Anything uncommon in the handling? Repulsorlift adjustments? Hyperdrive demotivator is calibrated correctly?", she queries for the typical things that might go wrong if the ship is pretty new from the assemply lines. All of those things are pretty little flaws, but can induce quite an increased wear on a ship if not fixed. She doesn't look up, waiting for the answer, looking at the datapad, stylus ready to put it into the work order.</p>
<p>"Well..." Bazil starts off, thinking back a few hours to himself... "For the most part, she is fine. A little rough in handling. Not as responsive as I would have imagined her to be. I wasn't with her for the trip from Corellia, but the pilot for that leg of the trip said she handled quite fine." He pauses, thinking to himself some more. Slowly, carefully, he studies the tech's face as he ponders, and finally adds, "I believe that is it... Oh, one more thing, her repulsorlifts were a tad bit shaky when she took off... barely noticable." He takes in a long, drawn out breath, and finishes, "Yeah... that's it. I just wanted to make sure she wasn't going to break in two the next time she jumps to hyperspace.</p>
<p>Lianna nods. "Good idea.", she says, not so much joking. A few clicks of the stylus. "I would say you have to calcualte about two hours, perhaps three. The repulsorsystem needs to be aligned propably. From what I heared, tey moved temselves to new positions. Happens when they are used and not settlet completely in their sockets. The maufractors are not firing them anymore, to save on the time to do it, and so they need to readjusted after some time. Should be fine.", she says, and now looks up again at the pilot, tilting her head slightly. "Anything else?", she asks, keying a command into the datapad without looking. Her signout. She's done for today.</p>
<p>"No, thank you profoundly. I appreciate you helping out, and everything." Bazil replies, offering a light smile in return. He relaxes his own stance, almost as if letting down his guard. "I think I'll go wait in the mess for now..." He says, furrowing his brows as he says such, talking mostly to himself, and not so much to the technician. He bobs his head softly, and again says, "Thank you, again." With that, he offers unto her a half-bow, before walking off towards the main hanger bays, slowly traversing the large areas.</p>
<p>Lianna nods. "Do not try the jello...", she warns, the first bit of jokingly sarcasm in her voice. After all she is off shift just now. She stuffs the datapad back into the back as the signing out affirmation arrives with a small chirp, then mock-salutes to a FleetOps officer up in Flight Control she talked eralier too, pressing her index finger on her lips as to say: 'Do not tell Lt. Heretin', grins slightly and begins to head for the elevator as well, a few meters behind the pilot.</p>
