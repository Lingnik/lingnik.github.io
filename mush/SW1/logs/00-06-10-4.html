Kartijan's Description:
Kartijan is 5'4, appears 125 lbs and wears a sleek blood red body suit
with the red and yellow FLS logo on a black circle emblazoned largely on
the upper back and a smaller one on her left upper arm. The suit appears
to have some protective reinforcement in strategic places. Additional
protection is given by armor-like plates strapped to her elbows,
shoulders, knees and shins. Heavy black boots, black gloves and a black
and yellow striped helmet complete her gear. Her blue eyes shine with
emotion.

Staging Area -- Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena

    Open and spacious, the staging area is bordered by high-grade security
fencing on three sides, and the arena. The viewing stands above wings out
to overhang the area, several repair shops and the stable house built
along the wall on the ground beneath it. High pylons suspend a transparent
arc of wide plasteel panels and thin durasteel mesh over the rest of the
area, stopping twenty feet over the security fencing to allow the sun and
wind to enter, but none of the accompanying inclement weather. Bay doors
on either side lead to the track and back out to the street, and a smaller
security door on the arena wall provides access to the spectator
facilities inside. Track security patrols the well-lit area frequently.

Kartijan is till moving slowly and holding a hand to her lower back as she
moves through the crowd towards the stables. She finds that moving closer
to the wall affords her a less jostling path and she stops as she
approaches Tarrin where is he being treated.

Tarrin looks up to Kartijan as the medic applies the bandages..

His hands in otherwise hidden pockets of his jumpsuit, Mege Vauki once
again blesses the staging areas with his presence.  Well... he's here
again, anyways. Anyway you look at it, though, he seems to be a little
down, despite the smile on his face.  His destination is Kartijan.

Kartijan Smiles faintly to Tarrin, nursing her own sores as she got yet
another banging during the race, herself. "Are you going to be okay,
Tarrin?" she asks, not yet realizing someone is approaching her.

Tarrin looks up to Kartijan and says softly, "I have had worse, the wampa
got a peice of me..."

"Hello there, Miss Lore, Mister Stardiver. That was a swell race you two
just participated in. I'm sorry to see what the Wampa did to you, though."
Mege smiles, his swooping jumpsuit still intact over his body. His steps
take him just a few feet from the pair.

Kartijan winces a bit in sympathy, a low maon of discomfort escaping her
lips, "Swoop racing is dangerous stuff indeed." She turns to the person
who is now talking to her and Tarrin and brings her hand forward from
where it was, sort of, comforting her lower back from all the thumping
around out on the track this evening. "Greetings, and thank you." She
inclines her head slightly, blinking once then extending her hand in
greeting.

Mege extends his own hand, grasping Kartijan's tightly, before releasing
it, "Mege Vauki, team KIF, Grade 1. You beat my score with that race of
yours... bumped me down to third place." A smile covers his face, showing
he isn't that concerned at the loss, "I commend you... and you, Mister
Stardiver. Compared with some of the other accidents this weekend so far,
you came out pretty well."

Tarrin says softly, "It wasn't that bad really.."

Kartijan's eyebrow rises slightly as Mege speaks, "Kartijan Lore, Team
FLS. Thank you again. I hope the accidents have not been many nor too
serious. I only just arrived right before the heat and have been to busy
with paperwork to keep track of the other racers." She blinks again and
places her hand back to its position at her lower back, a slight smile on
her lips, "Team KIF you say. Is Kestryan around?" She starts to rise to
tiptoe and look around the crowd, only to wince and stop smiling then wait
for an answer to her question.

"I believe he's up at the spaceport, in his ship, right now." Mege replies
to the question, before solemnly adding, "Several racers have been killed
so far. One from the Dianago, one from the Wampa. And, both of the
Pallando's are in the local hospital. Whitney took a bruising from the
Dianago, Ernie from the Wampa, I believe. Also, Altair Quila had a bit of
a run in with the vegetation in the Kashyyyk section." The words sound
like they come from some sort of news report.

Kartijan's face takes on a very low cast as she takes in the information.
"I see. Those who are not dead are expected to recover?" Her voice changes
tone to become something almost dispassionate itself. She looks over to
where Tarrin's attention has been re-taken by the medic who is now
speaking quietly with him about how best to facilitate his own recovery.

"Yes, I do believe so... hopefully, anyways." Mege peers down at Tarrin
for a moment, before returning his attention to Kartijan. His demeanor is,
despite his racer's appearnce, quite educated, and proper. His words are
formed with precision, if a bit poorly at moments. Signs of tiredness
appear now in his green eyes, now blending in with the heavily scarred
appearance of his face.

Kartijan smiles faintly again, "That is good to hear." Her demeanor does
not improve much as she seems to have a part of her attention focused
someplace else, perhaps in thought. After a moment she smiles more broadly
and says, "A moment," before she turns back to Tarrin and interrupts the
medic long enough to tell Tarrin she is glad Randel found him and that she
will talk to him later. She then turns back to Vauki and states, still
smiling, only with one side of her mouth quirked up a bit, "If we are
going to continue to talk, I have need to be seated as I injured my back
with that mis-jump at the Bespin section of the track."

"That would be quite nice. I have been on my feet most of the day,
anyways. Unless you have more pressing matters that is, of course." His
look calm and complacent over the recent situation; the woman beat him out
of his second place position, but he's far from angry about it. In fact,
he is still stunned he managed to place so high anyways, being the rookiee
he is.  "Where to?" comes the question of where to go to sit, as his hands
are withdrawn from the jumpsuit pockets, and the arms are crossed before
him.

Kartijan gestures past Tarrin and the medic towards the stables, "I am
just on my way to the FLS stables, you may join me there." She then turns
and walks past Tarrin with a last warm smile to him then thorugh the
entrance to the public stables.

"Alright, then." Mege simply follows after the woman, tailing only a foot
behind her.

Team FLS Stable Garage -- Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena

        Not quite a working garage, this corporate sponsored stable is a
clean affair with little in the way of tools or maintenance machinery. On
the rear wall is a trophy case and some pictures of the racing team. This
wall is painted black and at center the red and yellow FLS logo is
displayed in tri-dee glory. The other walls are the same gray as the
ferrocrete floor, which is kept amazingly free of grease stains. Each
swoop has it's own parking bay with a private locker area for the pilot.
The bays are along the wall to the left of the large retractable door. To
the right is a lounge area that is carpeted in black-dyed tauntaun wool
and furnished with a couple of sleek black nerf-leather couches and low
smoked glass tables. A bar/galley tended by a droid serves refreshments
and an entertainment center is available to watch live races or review
recorded ones.

 &lt;O>ut leads to Public Stable House -- Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena.

Kartijan moves over to the swoop but does not touch it as she peers around
one of the technicians to see how the repairs are going before nodding to
a security guard and then moving to the lounge area and seating herself at
one end of a couch. She says in a voice meant to carry to Mege over the
din of the pit crew as they work on the swoops using the tools and
machinery they brought for the occasion, "Sometimes it amazes me how
mobile the technician's swoop repair mechanisms are. By the middle of the
week this stable area will be cleared back down to the basics and all this
machinery will be back on Caspar I imagine."

Mege nods in reply, following the woman to the lounge, finally setting
himself a few feet from her on the same couch. He turns himself to face
her full on, and offers, "It's interesting, definately. And very useful,
if a team is unable to fully stock /each/ of their garages."

Kartijan eyes one particular of the pit crew who seems to be supervising
all the others, "I do believe it is as much because these are their
preferred tools as anything else." She grins broadly, "And considering
just how well those same tools have been at putting my swoop back together
each time I race I am glad as my Neut only gets better every time I have
an opportunity to use it."

"I would say so. You performed very well tonight." Mege grins widely,
folding his hands in his lap neatly. The hands--as well as his
face--contrast so very heavily against his pristine jumpsuit, the solitary
scar seeming to be a reminder of something long past. He isn't sure why
he's talking with this woman right now, but at least it is something to
do, no matter what.

The contrasts Vauki's person make versus the outfit he is sporting seems
not to bother Kartijan as she settles herself into a position wherein the
couch will support her lower back for her, leaving her to direct her
attention elsewhere, "Is there anything in particular you wish to speak
of?"

[OOC: Karti had to disconnect for the night.]

&lt;OOC> Kartijan says, "say we chat idly about the races for a whil or some
such? just so we can each go about other business and pretty much know
what we talked about here?"
&lt;OOC> Vauki says, "Oki. That works."
&lt;OOC> Kartijan says, "why we keep getting on the swoops in spite of the
injuries that sort of stuff (in Kart's case she had something to prove,
and once proven she realized she loves swooping as much as flying in space
so had no reason to stop)"
&lt;OOC> Vauki nods. Vauki's a first-time swooper, which would probably come
up, and his score of 199.
