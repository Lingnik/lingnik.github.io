<p>People Involved:  Morganna, Howie, Luke, Loraiil, Halloway, Captain Diggs
 (NPC Puppet:Bazil)</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Morganna's Description:
 Standing tall at around 5'11" and extremeley well built, this human woman
appears to have quite an imposing presence. The woman's skin is tanned and
her features are fairly attractive by human standards but her eyes are
quite unusual. Morganna's irises are a firey amber, outlined and flecked
with darker orange. As she blinks, it's clear that these eyes are real,
and that the pupils are slitted, giving this woman a bestial edge. Her
reddish brown hair is cropped short, it falls just over her ears and her
bangs fall over her forehead in a manner that gives her a slightly
disshelved appearance.  Morganna rarely smiles, but if one is so lucky as
to catch her without a scowl, the smiles rarely reach her slitted eyes.</p>
<p>A relatively clingly, black outfit graces Morganna's powerful, and
athletic form. Her top is half covered by a new, dark brown nerfhide
jacket which is long enough to reach her hips. A utility belt is slung
casually around her waist and contains such useful items as a datapad,
tools and an ornate, yet well used, vibroblade. Strapped to her thigh is a
heavy blaster. The orange eyed woman moves with the gait and deliberation
of a predator on the prowl.

<p>Luke's Description:
A slim, slightly-built youth dressed entirely in black. He has pleasantly
youthful, unassuming features, a gently cleft chin, and fair, sun-blond
hair. Though he is still young, there are indications in his face of
burdens too heavy for his years. Faint lines have been carved around his
mouth, and there is a heaviness in his expression now, the usual boyish
glimmer in his blue eyes has been all but replaced by a dark and brooding
melancholy, his lips drawn into grim lines.</p>
<p>He wears a black version of his standard Jedi attire: a loose, roughly
woven tunic over black shirt and pants, and a lightsaber clipped to the
worn utility belt at his waist. Though his appearance is not
extraordinary, his movements and demeanor are the exact opposite. Whether
he moves slowly or with haste, he does so deliberately -- not as a result
of age or infirmity, but in an elegant movement betokening a body and mind
completely in harmony, well-honed and supple.

<p>Howie's Description:</p>
<p>Human, he's definitely human and could even be a typical Corellian if
there is such a type. Standing at six feet tall, give or take an inch or
two, this man a short military cut brown hair and clear brown eyes. His
built isn't massive and big but he isn't a stick-like lanky person either,
pretty much evening out in between. This man looks to be in his late
twenties, a chiseled face of experience and is unmistakably etched into
his expressions. For now he seems to be exhausted by trying to hide that
fact from others, from his physical appearance. He still stands tall and
proud of who he is and what he belongs to.</p>
<p>He is currently wearing a navy blue fleet uniform, golden buttons
running up the middle to hold the uniform in together.  The uniform has
the appropriate patches and decorations in place to signify that the
wearer of this uniform is located in Fleet Operations and the Captain of
the Deliverance. His rank pips inform you that he is currently a Captain
of the New Republic Navy, with two little badges showing that this man
participated in the battle of Endor and Bakura. He wears a black belt that
fashions a silver clasp, fitted against his waist, keeping his matching
navy blue trousers on. One his blue trousers is a pair of new looking
Corellian Bloodstripes running up the sides. An occupied blaster holster
is fitted through the belt, along with an extra pouch for an assortment of
things.</p>

<p>Captain Diggs' Description:
This man is about five-foot-ten-inches... a strong, yet thin build, and
dark complexion. He is clothed in an entirely black outfit, with only a
single patch residing on it, reading as 'NRI -- Captain J. Diggs.' A
single DD6 blaster resides at the side of his waist.</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Security Section -- NRSC Deliverance</p>
<p>This area is the Security Section of the Deliverance. A circular
bank of monitors and computer stations stands in the middle of the room.
Along the far wall are three long hallways, each leading to a different
cell block. Several Security personnel are on duty inside the command
post, while others patrol the hallways and cell blocks. In an alcove to
starboard, guarded by two ever-vigilante Marines, is the ship's main
Armory. (INSPECT LOCKER)</p>

 &lt;S>tarboard leads to Detention Cell.
 &lt;A>ft leads to Interdeck Lift -- NRSC Deliverance.</p>
<p>The turbolift doors open up swiftly yet silently, revealing seven
different people. Stepping out of the turbolift is Captain Darklighter who
is leading the group along with Captain Diggs, Ensign Keldoran and four of
the Cruiser's security force. They proceed into the security section
quietly with the Captain in the lead.</p>
<p>Several steps behind the rest of the crew entering the facility comes
Skywalker, dressed in black as usual, looking solemn and even a little
distant. He glances around the security corridor and moves slowly to
Captain Darklighter's side. "Just make sure your men take every
precaution. It's too easy to underestimate her, Captain."</p>
<p>As solemn, quiet, and cold-faced as Diggs is, he almost doesn't fit in
with the rest of the group, seeming quite like some sort of stereotyped
Imperial. Sure, he's not, but that doesn't keep him from letting this
demeanor out. He walks along with the others, nearly at Howie's side.</p>
<p>Being recently promoted to Midshipman, Loraiil was allowed to attend the
interrogation. Now he is at the side, standing at attention, waiting for
the interrogation to begin.</p>
<p>The stirrings of people near her cel cause Morganna to open one of her cat
eyes groggily. It looks like they've learned their lesson, as the beast
inside the cage is sedated and groggy. Being sedated Makes her angry, but
there's not a hell of alot she can do about that when her body amd nost of
her mind refuses to cooperate.  That's not to say that Morganna isn't
dangerous, not by a long shot. once roused a little more, Morganna may be
able to push some of the grogginess away.. Morganna closes her eye again
and waits.</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking your time to be here, Master Skywalker. We on the
Deliverance owe you a lot of thanks for what you have done so far for us
and what will most likely come as well." The Captain smiles thinly at the
Jedi. Howie seems to be pretty tired from the looks of things but he is
attempting to mask that well. He then nods at the warning before looking
at his people, nodding to Captain Diggs first but addresses the four
security officers, "Remember what I discussed.  Weapons are set on stun
/only/. If things go not as planned, stun everyone in the room besides
Master Skywalker if necessary, we will not take any chances. Captain
Diggs, I'll let you take charge of this but I will be monitoring your
progress. If I think you're too rough on her, I'll order you out and the
discussion," Yes, he used the word discussion instead of interrogation,
that one diplomatic mission must be getting to him, "is over, understood?
If everyone is ready, let us proceed."</p>
<p>Absolutely, Captain." The NRI officer's words are sharp, short, and
carefully constructed. This ought to be one interesting interrogation,
that's for sure. A mere mortal against a sith? He cocks his head towards
his belt, pulling the small blaster from it's black case, double-checking
the setting, before setting it back in place. He makes a deliberate motion
to leave it unhitched, however. Sure, it'll be dangerous if that animal of
a woman gets too close, but it's the only way he can get to it quick
enough, himself...</p>
<p>Nothing more to add, Luke simply nods his assent to the Captain and draws
a breath, mentally preparing himself and calling upon the Force to calm
him before what will surely be a less than pleasant confrontation with the
woman who's caused so much turmoil and pain in so many lives. "Let's get
this over with."</p>
<p>As he watches the "discussion", as Captain Diggs so succintly put,
proceed, a slight shiver runs through Loraiil. What if this vile woman
unleashed her dark force powers and overwhelmed Master Skywalker? What
could a mere "mortal"  like him with nothing but a blaster carbine do to
harm her? Nothing. Loraiil tried to dismiss the thoughts, but the remained
in the back of his mind while he fingers with the blaster at his hip.</p>
<p>She catches whispers of the conversation from beyond the magnetic field.
Whether she's picking up thoughts or voices is lost to Morganna in this
state. Everything seems like a blur, all of the moises blend together into
a distracting cacophony. The whirring of the ventilation, the humming of
the field.. the gentle dripping of the tap. Everything seems loud. Too
loud.</p>
<p>With a slight nod to the group, Captain Darklighter seems to hesitate, not
wanting to do this at all but knowing that it must be done, for the
Republic. "Alright, lets go." With another nod, the Captain proceeds
towards the correct cell but doesn't deactivate yet, waiting for everyone
to get ready one final time and for the security officers to get into
position, two standing by the cell entrance, the other two standing at the
other side, behind the group at hand, all with their rifles ready, set on
stun, directed at the prisoner. When everyone is set, he nods to the
security personnel manning the station outside the corridor and have him
deactivate the forcefield. Bzzzz, it's off.</p>
<p>Luke enters the detention cell.

<p>Detention Cell</p>
<p>As you descend a few stairs through a little door, you find
yourself in a very small room. As the door closes behind you, you realize
that you are surrounded by four black walls. There are no windows or
visible doors other than the outline of the one you came in. In this very
small room, there is a bed built into the back wall, a small sink built in
the right wall and a small toilet next to it. There appears to be no way
out. Welcome to the Detention Cell.</p>

<p>As soon as the field is deactivated, Luke steps inside first, his eyes and
his other senses attuned to the sedated woman inside the cell before
anyone else can become a target. His breathing is utterly controlled and
regulated as he goes to the bunk and bends over to touch Morganna's
temple, closing his eyes in an attempt to bring her very slowly out of the
sedated state. But only her mind... his body he allows to stay as relaxed
as possible, so relaxed that muscles refuse to obey physical commands.
These are powers he would rarely use, and even now it's only to defend the
officers who accompany him that he exerts this influence -- aware of how
dangerous she is in this situation. "Tazecks," he says quietly. "Wake up.
Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>Captain Diggs marches in a few moments after the Jedi. His eyes
automatically dart around the room, and he moves off the side, staring
down at Luke and Morganna, his eyes fixeated on her as he studies her
intently, much the way a Sabacc player would study his or her opponent. He
maneuvers his arms behind him, and clasps them there, standing quite
erect.</p>
<p>Loraiil pauses before the cell entrance and stands stiffly at attention,
fear evident in his face. What if she would choke him like Darth Vader had
countless souls? Or if she would torture him in some way? What if...What
if, the thoughts circled in his head.</p>
<p>The murmurs and mixed sounds suddenly snap into audible focus as Luke
gently coaxes Morganna's mind out of its drowsy state. The cat eyed woman
keeps her eyes closed as she tries to use her newfound clarity to pull
some muscular control to at least her mouth but, perhaps soon, her hands..
and her legs. She finally opens her eyes and growls, her voice slightly
slurred and growling "Yes.. Don't think.. you can hold me. forever,
Skywalker.. I'm stronger thasn you think.." Morganna says that with a
baiting tone, and she takes a deep breath, a breeze fropm out of nowhere
ruffles Luke's cloak, but nothing else.  Anger makes her strong, and her
own anger and fear builds now that the glorious cover of darkness is gone.
Unfortunately she's weak, and even that small effort gives her a
headache... for now.</p>
<p>Halloway comes in from the security sector.
Halloway has arrived.
Halloway enters Detention Cell.</p>
<p>Halloway stands towards the back of the room, keeping an eye out for
anything odd.</p>
<p>Howie steps in between Morganna and Diggs for now, nodding to him to wait
for him first before starting the discussion with the Moff. The Captain
doesn't address the Moff as of yet, letting Luke do his Force thing on her
and give him the all clear signal before starting anything. Nothing can go
wrong here or it would lead to a very bad end. The Captain's eyes drifts
over towards the people in here and outside as well, two guards entered
with the group while the other two remained at the top of the stairwell,
keeping their rifles trained on the Moff, in stun mode.</p>
<p>(OOC: Halloway has disconnected.)</p>
<p>It isn't without any effort that Luke keeps control of Morganna, and the
strain shows on his face as he concentrates on her. He still spares a
moment to glance behind him at the others, worried at the general nervous
aura being given off by certain people in the cell. Worried that, like a
caged animal, the Moff will feed off this fear, he consciously soothes it,
knowing that panic itself could be the best weapon at Morganna's disposal.
Luke comes to sit next to Morganna, folding his hands on his knees and
leaning forward as he keeps the strong hold on her. "I don't need to hold
you forever, Morganna. Just long enough to... find out from you what you
might now about the Death Star?" He grits his teeth, his eyes narrowing,
taking on an almost ruthless glint. "It's the only way I'll let you go,
Tazecks... and we both know I can outlast you."</p>
<p>Captain Diggs slowly blinks, reflexively. A strange feeling overcomes him
slightly, as he calms even more than he already was. He frowns to himself,
before shifting his feet slightly, looking from Luke to Morganna, Morganna
to Luke. He intently studies both of their faces and body motions. His
silence continues, as he listens to the pair solemnly. Mentally, he's a
bit bored... he's done this sort of thing before. After thirty years of
service, one gets used to these sort of proceedings. Just because the
prisoner is a force-user doesn't make any difference to him, as long as
Luke is here. He heard about the earlier incident, however... he won't
make the same mistake as those folks did.</p>
<p>Loraiil glances toward the middle-aged man who just arrived, and is
relieved by his presence, or more likely the presence of the blaster at
his belt. He is starting to become angry at himself for being so cowardly.
What did he have to lose, except his life. He almost snorted at the
thought. If he was lucky, and the interrogation turned into a disaster, he
might be unimportant enough just to be flung aside, and...No. He had sworn
an oath to the New Republic, to preserve the lives of his comrades and
commanding officers. If this whole thing turned sour, and he were to die,
his last living movement would be to switch the blaster to "Kill" and blow
that witches head off. Stunned by his sudden change of mind, Loraiil
shakes his head and tries to concentrate on the happenings inside the
cell, where Master Skywalker is trying to restrain Morganna while the
General is leading the interrogation.</p>
<p>The laugh that Morganna manages to muster, despite the ironclad mental
hold that Luke has on her, is chilling at best. She takes a deep breath
and keeps her eyes closed, feeding off the nervousness of the people
around her and making Luke's job just a little bit harder.. until the calm
hits. Morganna growls and mentally gnaws at luke's hold like a feriocious
beast, but he is right.. he will outlast her, "What do I know about it?"
she asks slowly, her voice still little more than a cold hiss, "I know ti
exists. I know it blew up a planet. beyond that.." Morganna pauses long
enough for dramatic effect, "I know nothing." Morganna manages a slight
smile and her eyes open, "So.. are they going to interrigate me properly
now?" Morganna closes her eyes again, hoping they fall for that, after
all.. the pain would just make her life so much easier.</p>
<p>Captain Darklighter was feeling pretty edgy, he has seen Imperials before
but this one is different, definately different. But with Luke's calming
technique, the Captain manages to relax a bit and the hope in his mind for
victory against the Death Star and the Empire blossoms even more now, fear
slinking away and courage rising to replace it.  Taking another step
towards Morganna, the Captain with surprising calm greets the Moff.
"Greetings Moff Tazecks. I apologize to have to put you in a situation
like this and for your condition. I had hoped to meet under different
circumstances than this. There will be no interrogation, we're here to
discuss the details of the Death Star. This man here is a Captain and he
will be talking to you about the Death Star. About it's plans, it's
origin, potiential targets, stuff like that. I wish to make your stay much
more pleasant but again, circumstances dictate otherwise." With that said,
Howie turns and nods towards Captain Diggs, allowing him to begin.</p>
<p>For a moment, Luke hesitates, wondering if he should do as Morganna, and
indeed everyone, expects him to do.  Proper interrogation methods won't
work on her, and he knows it. When might he ever have this chance again?
Some of the old anger boils in him again, and he doesn't work quite as
hard to douse it this time. Even as Howie begins to speak, Luke
concentrates harder, reaching out with his senses to strip away the
uppermost layers of Morganna's conscious thought. When he speaks, it's not
aloud, but directly into her mind. _Are you going to show me, or do I have
to come in and find it?_ he asks her with a calm but frightrening voice.</p>
<p>Although Diggs was all the time staring at Morganna and Luke, he manages
to interpret Howie's motions with ease. Slowly, he steps foward, and
kneels down slightly, so as to give him a better vantagepoint for staring
at the woman intently. He starts off, slow and casual, moving his voice on
the edge of kindness, "Morganna, my name is Jonau Diggs. I apologize for
the conditions as well, but they are required given your... special
abilities." His speech sounds like some sort of formula, the way he puts
it out. He doesn't let any unnecessary words out, keeping his talking well
coordinated. "Do you know where the Empire constructed their new Death
Star?" Sure, the question is simple, and very capably allows for any
taunting, or snide comments on Morganna's side. He at least has to find
out what kind of mood she'll be taking during the questionings.</p>
<p>Intrigued by Captain Diggs' professionalism, Loraiil draws slightly nearer
to watch, but not near enough to let Morganna notice. A strange exchange
seems to be going on between both Jedi, seemingly a struggle, if the
intense expressions on both of their faces was any indication.</p>
<p>The sith moff inhales sharply as Luke's voice reverberates around in her
mind. /Three/ different voices respond in unison, one childlike, one
neutral and the other bestial, _We have told you all we know, Skywalker._
Morganna gains the strngth to shake her head lightly, as though that will
help her mind fight this. Dark claws from the beastial side of Morganna
claw uselessly at the barrier of light that holds its master. Morganna
opens her eyes and tries her best to ignore the pounding in her head, "I
don't know anything.." she says slowly, "Except that if you keep me here,
I'm sure the next target will have your families on it." Morganna takes a
deep breath and her tone turns bitter and snide, "I can tell you the
weather on Selene right now."</p>
<p>The Captain doesn't flinch or piss in his pants as his family is
mentioned, in fact it doesn't phase him at all when the Moff threatened
his family, rather odd. "Moff Tazeck, please let us work together,
cooperate with us. After you have told us what we need to know to end this
senseless bloodshed, we will return you to your planet, Selene. That I
guarantee you, I vow to you. You may even ask Master Skywalker here...
please, I beg you not for myself, but for all the innocent people who live
out there in the galaxy, please cooperate with us so we can stop the
senseless weapon of destruction."</p>
<p>Before Luke can react to what the voices in Morganna's head are telling
him, he begins peeling back layer after layer, finding the rage and fear
rendered deep on every level as he sorts through her memories. Rather than
pausing on those that formed her twisted personality, Luke finds those
moments that impacted his life most deeply: the Moff's conspiracy with
Lady Dawntreader. It's a selfish venture, but he can't stop himself... at
least until he realizes the abuse and pain that led her to live in the
state she is in now. Breathing hard, the Jedi eases his prying somewhat,
though not his purpose.  _If I find out you're lying to me, Morganna, it
won't matter what the Death Star does, because you'll be destroyed with
us._</p>
<p>"Please, Morganna. I do not wish to be your enemy in this." Jonau starts,
his starings having continued even while others spoke, trying his best to
analyze the woman. "Do you know anything about the Death Star besides what
resides as common knowledge to us?" His words are now calm, cool, and
almost loving... like a father talking to his daughter. He knows he can't
get through to her by himself. There's way too much willpower in this one
-- he can tell that fact already. Almost as if searching for help, Diggs
turns towards Luke, searching his face slowly for that very help, his
eyebrows constricting softly, almost too minutely to be noticed.</p>
<p>Seemingly out of nowhere, the soft beeping of a comlink tears Loraiil out
of his reverie. It takes him a few seconds to notice it is his own, and he
pulls back a little to hear the message. The others have not noticed the
sound.  "Midshipman Keldoran here.......yes...what, NOW? I'm in an
import...but...yes, understood." He sighs and catches the attention of one
of the security guards: "Listen up...", he gazes at the
nameplate,"Corporal Rogar, there is an emergency situation in the hangar
bay, and i need to get there now. I hope you can take care of the
situation without me." The guard looks at him as if noticing him for the
first time. "Sure, no problem. We'll handle it.", he says. Loraiil nods,
and moves up the entryway, out of sight.</p>
<p>At every level that Luke peels back, Morganna's mind fights out of fear
and anger. Demons with needle like teeth skirt between her memories. The
only thing relating to the Death star in there, however, is a conversation
on the bridge of a ship. No details, just 'Look what we have' from Valak
himself. Morganna takes a deep breath and tries to fight Luke away from
other related thoughts.. Jack Raven on the same ship.. looking at the
Death Star.. and something about a Krayt Dragon. Morganna's deepest fears
and secrets try to hide in the dark recesses of her mind as Luke violates
their sanctuary..  this woman has not had an easy life. She sighs in
exasperation, although her words take a while to come as her mind is busy
elsewhere, "No. I.. wasn't told anything.. other than it existed.. Lord
Valak keeps his secrets.. well.. hidden." Her eyes remain closed.</p>
<p>When finally Luke is convinced that Morganna is telling the truth, he
hesitates, drawn back to the images of the Krayt Dragon -- and remembering
that Valak had purchased one from the doomed Jack Raven. He plunders those
memories, forcing her to show him, a bead of sweat forming on his forehead
as he struggles to find a focus. _So you know nothing about the Death
Star,_ he relents, before tightening his mental hold on her. _Then tell me
what Valak wants with a Krayt Dragon?  Where did he take it?_</p>
<p>The Captain of the Deliverance is silent for a few long seconds as he
looks at Diggs, then towards Luke. "If you do not know the answers, Moff
Tazecks, then we will not force anything out of you. This is a discussion,
not an interrogation, I wish for us to be friends, Ms. Tazecks, not
enemies. It's the situation that forces us into these predicaments." The
Captain then grows quiet as he doesn't have anything else to say and isn't
an expert in these fields, he only glances at Diggs, nodding to him.</p>
<p>"Anything else? Did he maybe hint anything to you?" Diggs' peerings go
back to the woman as he inquires. They must be talking, in their heads...
or however it was that they do it. It had been a long time since the NRI
officer had studied the very hush-hush information on the Jedi and
force... Turning towards Luke again, he blinks. The beat of sweat.  
"Skyw&#8212;" He stops mid-word... he mustn't interrupt the man if he's
concentrating that hard. Instead, he turns his head further, to offer a
short frown at Howie. He isn't exactly in control of the situation... it's
not his favorite feeling.</p>
<p>The cat eyed moff opens her eyes for a moment and she takes a deep breath.
She shakes her head and moves her mouth, but no sound is heard, _I don't
know where. I had to board the ship to get there._ The only audible thing
that comes from Morganna is a Growl, and it is a sound that is amplified
within her mind. Morganna bundles her thoughts around her fear and anger
and she pushes at Skywalker's grip as hard as she can, he has gotten too
close to too many personal things. The Anger gives her strength and she
actually manages to move her fingers, this may not be a good sign. The
only image that comes through morganna's mind at the excitement of the
Krayt, the only thing that is easily fetched, is Morganna running through
a Jungle. That could be just about anywhere.</p>
<p>Darklighter also sees that perhaps some sort of private exchange is going
on, either that or the way Luke is controlling her is pretty odd, but to
Howie, he doesn't understand Jedi and whatever they do sometimes is
strange to him. All he does is shake his head slightly at Diggs, his
expression telling him to don't worry about it, let Luke do his thing and
all will hopefully be fine, in other words, lets live through tonight.
When the Moff's finger moves slightly however, the guards tense up on
their grips of their rifles, their aim never wavered through the entire
meeting. Howie's hand twitches slightly as he was about to go to his
pistol but relaxes once more putting his trust, his life in Skywalker's
hands.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a frivolous indulgence to pursue this with Morganna... but
part of Luke knows that there's something else going on, and he can't get
rid of that itching, nagging feeling in the back of his head. Then,
indelicately, Luke withdraws his mind from hers and rises to his feet,
surprised that he's able to maintain his balance, and using the surplus
energy to more powerfully bind her physical movement. "She doesn't know
anything more. Valak obviously doesn't trust her enough to share this kind
of sensitive information. It just shows he's being cautious.. not
surprising considering the lack of intelligence we have on the Death
Star." He's remarkably candid considering that an Imperial Moff is right
next to him. But Morganna does not even get another glance from Skywalker.</p>
<p>Jonau almost sighs, as he stands. Not the most productive interrogation of
all time, "Master Skywalker... did you get anything from her?" Diggs' tone
is almost jealous, but softened... he is disappointed of what little he
got out of here... perhaps the Jedi Master got something that noone else
in the room could have possibly picked up.</p>
<p>The anger, the pain and the humiliation of having her mind rifled through
build up inside Morganna but.. when the guards twitch in shock at the fact
Morganna has moved, it gives her enough energy to release the beast.
Unfortunately, Morganna doesn't have a heck of alot of motor control and
so, as her pupils narrow to slits, morganna swiftly moves in on Luke..
with her teeth, gripping the Jedi master on the shoulder with an attack
that she knows he won't expect. She growls and allows her darkness to take
over, not caring at the moment if people open fire on her. All she wants
is revenge at Luke for gooing places unrelated. _Grr..._</p>
<p>With a wave to stop Diggs from prodding any further, the Captain just
shakes his head, "I'm sure she knows nothing else, Captain Diggs. We have
to trust Master Skywalker with what he says and I personally trust him
quite a bit. I know this was your field but she isn't your average
interrogatee, she's speci..." Before he could finish the word, the Captain
catches the sudden motion and quickly reaches for his pistol. While he
draws, the guards who have an open shot quickly, without any hestitation
unleash a blast bolt at the Moff. Two guards doesn't fire as Luke blocks
but the other two fires, one from above, the other from one corner of the
room.</p>
<p>Luke reacts quickly, though he was indeed taken offguard, and he pries
Morganna off of him even as the stun blasts impact her body. He winces as
he places her body onto the small bunk, then stands and frowns deeply,
unamused. "I'm sorry about that. Next time I guess, muzzle her." He smirks
and rubs at his shoulder, feeling it ache. As he fixes his gaze on Captain
Diggs, Luke sighs. "If you would like to talk to her, I suggest doing so
from behind the force field. I don't think you'll find anything that I
didn't find. I'm pretty convinced she's telling the truth." Glancing over
his shoulder, the Jedi shakes his head sadly.</p>
<p>As the stunbolts hit, Morganna's body jerks, falling away from luke, with
the help of the jedi of course.  Morgannamanages one more growl before she
receieves enoughs stin bolts to take out a bantha (Or close to it). The
last thing she thinks before the lights go out is, "Ha! I bit him.."
Morganna seems so much more at peace now that she isn't moving.  Perhaps
that's why she attacked.. Sleep is so much more preferable to conciousness
when you hate being confined.</p>
<p>With a simple, and curt nod, Jonau replies, "I'm sorry I wasn't able to
offer more help. I am unaccustomed to working with such people. At least
we know that it was, indeed, the Empire that constructed this latest
device." He sighs, briefly, before turning towards Howie, "Captain, unless
you need me further, I need to go make my report to headquarters --
despite how limited it will be."</p>
<p>"Sithspawn... she bites. Literally..." The Captain mutters as he nods to
the guards as they swarm in briefly to make sure that the captive is out.
"Good job guys, and good reflexes. Get a medic in too to see to Master
Skywalker." He then looks back towards Diggs, "Of course Captain, we'll
speak about this more after you're done if you wish. I think Intel is
going to have to work much harder now since we know Valak isn't even
trusting his personal servants." With a sigh, Howie moves towards the Moff
and looks at the stunned figure, shaking his head slightly. "You all
right, Master Skywalker? That caught us completely offguard... and it
seems Valak is much smarter than the Emperor, we still have... nothing."</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Luke assures the Captain as he rolls his shoulders, glad that
Morganna didn't do much more than bruise him. "I'm sorry there was nothing
to be found. Perhaps you can find another... use for her." He turns,
indicating for everyone to file out of the room so that he is the last one
to leave Morganna alone in the room.</p>
<p>Security Section -- NRSC Deliverance</p>
<p>This area is the Security Section of the Deliverance. A circular
bank of monitors and computer stations stands in the middle of the room.
Along the far wall are three long hallways, each leading to a different
cell block. Several Security personnel are on duty inside the command
post, while others patrol the hallways and cell blocks. In an alcove to
starboard, guarded by two ever-vigilante Marines, is the ship's main
Armory. (INSPECT LOCKER)</p>

<p>Howie steps out of the cell with the others, nodding to Luke. "Of course
Master Skywalker. The plan you had seems excellent, benefits everyone. The
Moff will be off of this ship and out of our hair, and hopefully we'll be
in Caspar's good graces. I'm going to arrange transport down to the planet
too. You can accompany me if you wish but I'm sure you're very tired after
that ordeal." The Captain pauses before adding, "Again, thank you Master
Skywalker. You've been more than a great help to us."</p>
<p>Luke places a hand lightly on Howie's shoulder as he nods. "I hope it's
successful. I'm not usually the diplomat of the family," he says wryly.
"I'll stop by the medsection, then I'm getting some rest. I suggest you
all do the same. There's no use in getting yourselves fatigued before the
battle has really begun."</p>
<p>"I will after we have our things straighten out, we can't spare any time
in these days of gloom. I promise to get some rest when I finish meeting
with the President of Caspar again." The Captain replies with a firm nod
to the Jedi.  "Don't worry, I won't die out just from lack of sleep, we'll
have things up and running soon." With a smile and a last nod, the Captain
heads out of the security section.</p>
