Fountain Square

The huge buildings in the background threaten to take over this small
patch of green that is the center of Plaxton City. A stone fountain
-still in place from another time- sits in the center of the square. It
depicts a young woman looking into the sky. Water flares around her and
bursts into a star pattern ten feet above her head. The inscription at
the base of the fountain is written in the aging language of a more
romantic time. 'Farewell, for all journeyers that leave this place shall
always return to call it home.'
Newly planted, lush trees now dominate the square, shading the area
from the night sky above is filled with rain clouds as light rain falls.
Dark bushy leaves cover the branches, offering shade for the ground
below. Patches of well maintained grass surround the base of the trees,
allowing space for visitors to relax or picnic. The central, most famous
area of Plaxton City, seems to become more and more park-like with the
frequent additions and maintnence. A pair of Marines quietly watch over
the area.				


Hinrich
A chill would run up your spine, after a glance of this man. Draped over
his body is a dark cloak, swaying gently with the wind as he walks, a
hood is pulled over his head, and his head is covered by a small helmet,
fitting close to his face, going along his cheek bones softly, much like
an Imperial Stormtroopers, except this one, has less room around the
bottom, for grabbing under, and removing the helmet. Under the helmet,
would be the handsomely framed face, with his chin length light brown
hair, and hazel eyes, his voice, also is rather soothing, and deep.

Over his chest is a black piece of chest armor, still giving off an
Imperial Stormtrooper look to it, running smoothly over his muscled
chest, and covering his arms, where on a wrist blaster is placed, on his
right wrist.

Starting around from above the leg armor, would be a set of painted on
flames, small parts of it are chipped off, and charred, from the blows
this man has received, the flames flick upwards to the bottom part of
his chest, the tips of the flames being yellow, and they slowly fade
into the deep crimson red.

Looking downtward, to his legs, you notice they are also covered by the
dark black armor, on his thigh, would be a small scratch, from a small
blaster, no doubt, the entire set of his lower body armor, runs along
his legs rather smoothly.

At the side of his left leg, would be a Slasher Carbine, placed on the
outer part of his thigh. Hinrich seems to look to be about an average
build, and 5'11" tall.

If you would have the chance to see him, without his torso armor, you
would notice that covering his right arm, shoulder, and going down his
spine, are tattoos. His right arm tattoo, would be a set of black
flames, leading down from his neck, covering the front, and back of his
shoulder, and going all the way down to his wrist, where it stops
abruptly, for covering purposes. Leading from the bottom of his neck, is
a gothic style sword, the top of the tattoo being the blunt, hilt end,
leading down to the sword guard, which lead outwards, and then up and
down for two inchs, the actual blade part of the sword, widened near the
hilt, and leading inward, to the tip of the sword, the entire thing,
being a bright red color.

Orson
Too short, not handsome, and a little too old. What's lacking in looks
has to be made up for with something strong on the inside: determination
and persistence, a certain grit evident in the look sent by his slate
gray eyes. Lines around this human male's mouth and eyes tell of hard
days and decisions in his past, each one a new crease in an otherwise
young man's face. He is smaller framed, though quite stout with a barrel
chest and strong shoulders. Still, he's not overly muscled, simply in
good physical shape. Dark hair is kept in a simple style but is more
often than not in a disheveled state. A few lonely gray hairs touch his
temples. He might be around forty standard years old. He has a larger
nose, on a round-shaped, bold face that is quick with a grin but usually
caught up in a shade of thoughtful. About a week's worth of trimmed
beard covers his face, peppered with dark gray; the facial hair lends
Orson's face additional depth and distinction.

He is wearing neutral gray trousers, made of a thick fabric, only
remarkable in that they represent hylomorphic "pants". A simple but
heavy jacket, made of similar but darker cloth, hangs on his shoulders.
Where it parts in front, a form-fitting white shirt with straight
stripes shows itself. Dark boots round out the wardrobe. Despite its
simplicity and economy, every garment is clean and well-kept. Even if
unassuming, details are important to this man.

Jessalyn
The composure of this young human woman is probably the most striking
thing about her. Though otherwise unassuming, her expression is one of
surprising coherence and calm, belied only by the slightly mischievous
gleam in her leaf green eyes. Shining dark red hair falls in unruly
silken waves down to the middle of her back, framing her wide cheekbones
and smooth, pale skin not as fragile as most redheads'. She is
relatively tall for a human woman, with long-boned limbs and a natural
grace amplified by her skills.
She is wearing a dark green, long-sleeved shirt beneath a velvet black
tunic that is belted at her narrow waist. The full sleeves are cinched
above her pale, slender wrists. A pair of tight, dark green pants are
tucked into knee-high black leather boots, both complementing the best
pair of legs in ten parsecs.


Bazil
Cerulean eyes gleam under any light amongst a slew of less daunting
features. Masculine, the figure seems old at first glance, but often
gives way to handsome ruggedness. Large numbers of scars--some quite
fresh--streak over his face, dark brown hair contrasting against his
light skin. Freshly cut and placed, his hair lays simply atop his head,
little embellishment placed there. No facial hair strikes across his
face other than his brows, a long deep scar striking diagonally across
his face, and through one of the patches of eye hair. His nose is simple
and unpronounced, the sides slightly poking out from the rest of the
roundish figure. Simple, yet full, lips cover his face, the only other
noticible facial feature on him. His body rises at a rather average and
unimposing height, kept in shape, but without a large amount of
musculature.

     His legs are covered in dark sandy colored cargo pants, with a
matching belt around his waist. Pockets rest over his knees, and in the
other /normal/ spots. They hang loosely from him, drifting with the wind
casually, giving hint to their /very/ thin fabric. His feet are covered
in greybrown shoes, which come just under the joint of his foot. As for
a shirt, he bears a black dress shirt, streamed with pearl white
buttons. The shirt is tucked in to his pants. As for his belt, it bears
a solitary blaster, and an ornate sword.




Well. Now that we're done wandering through the landing pad. Let's
wander through the city a little bit, shall we? The bounty hunter,
Hinrich makes his way in from the south street, his cloak still covering
the the majority of his body armor and over shadowing the front facial
part of his helmet. He looks around to the others amongst the square for
a moment.. Slowing his pace down a little.

"That, and the people dressed up like tribesmen," Orson says, wearing a
wry smile as he and his companion move down one of the pathways under
trees. They are vaguely circumnavigating the fountain, having had enough
time there lately. Enough time, and enough strange people. This
well-trafficked spot seemed to draw strange people and bad characters. A
magic fountain, perhaps. Orson gives Hinrich an appraising look from the
corner of his eye.


Walking arm in arm with Orson along the shady path, Jessalyn gives a
light laugh, her head tilted to the side to gaze over at her companion.
"You don't say?" she comments on the ending of the story, looking
amused. Her gaze flutters over the people nearby, as well, seemingly
casual, but secretly alert to anything that might be construed as
suspicious or troubling. The young Jedi has a knack for sniffing out
that kind of thing, as recent events have shown.

     From the south, strolls Bazil again, looking quite. Well. Not
drunk. At all. Compared to a while ago, in the bar. Anyways, he strolls,
frowning. Bored. Perhaps he should have some young lady throw him into
the fountain by accident, like when he was first here so many years ago.


There's a small surprise. A Jedi having a knack for sniffing out things
that might cause trouble. Seeing nothing interesting at the moment..
Hinrich begins to quicken his pace back to the quick walking he was
doing before. Making his way off toward the bar, the bottom of the cloth
hanging over him beginning to pick up slightly, giving anyone who's
paying enough attention the ability to see his armored boots.

"There's Bazil," Orson notes, mildly, waving at his distant form when
the agent looks vaguely in their direction. It's not an inviting wave,
simply a 'there you are' type thing, and Orson quickly lowers his hand,
leading the woman down another path. "Have you had any more contact with
our person?" Despite the fact that they are out of most people's hearing
range, the mechanic chooses not to use names. Not in the square, out in
the open.

"He's been keeping low, I guess," Jessalyn replies with a mild shrug,
not needing any names supplied to know who Orson is talking about. She
glances toward Bazil as he's pointed out, dipping her head slightly in a
distant greeting. Her hand tightens around Orson's arm as they drift
down another path.

     Bazil continues on, offering a short wave to Orson in reply, before
stuffing hands in pockets, and lolloping about in boredom. Caspar was so
boring. So much waiting. So much nothing. Bah. He should go find Karrde
sometime soon. Hey. There's an idea.
     And so, Bazil sets his course for Orson, with a purpose. A
question.


With that, Hinrich slips his way into the bar. Not much here either.


Orson has already turned his back to Bazil, pointing out some feature on
a medium-height flowering tree that the couple is passing. With a nod at
Jessalyn, he turns to the approaching agent after slowing. "Hey," the
man greets quietly, for the third time in the last few hours. Reading
the look on Bazil's face, Orson takes in a breath.

The red-haired woman beside Orson turns as he does, unsurprised to see
Bazil there. Jessa offers a somewhat hesitant smile, sensing the tension
that goes through the man beside her. "Hello again," she offers, her
footfalls coming to a stop.

     A smile, now, quaint and nonchalant from Bazil, to Jessalyn and
Orson. He bows. He peers towards Orson, and offers, "Hello. Apologies
for earlier."
     Then, to Orson.
     "Orson, I would have you keep this in secrecy from all but you and
he, but I would like you to contact Karrde, if that is still possible
for you, and to inform him that I'm looking to speak with him," He
offers in a near-whisper, appearing not to give much of a care that
Jessalyn was there. "I would be most appreciative if you could do such."

"I can contact him," Orson replies evenly. No harm in admitting that.
Karrde was only slightly more wanted by the Empire than the mechanic
himself, which seemed a little odd. Not that Bazil was working with the
Empire. But caution was a good idea, nonetheless. "Are you going to try
and kill him?" The secrecy business is no problem. They are both in the
secrecy business, as a matter of fact. And Jessalyn, well, she has
secrets of her own, and little interest in these affairs. Orson's own
interest is waning. He hangs on to the old Orson with tenacity.

     Bazil was number eleven on the Empire's most wanted list. There
were only Republic members on that list. But Bazil didn't know that.
What he also didn't know was that there were only twelve people on that
list, and the last person on it was Kelvis. To put it blankly: He wasn't
as important as he prided himself to be.
     "I think not, Orson. He and I have a sort of mutual agreement," He
grins, "I don't kill him, and he doesn't kill me."

The Jedi woman's hand stays on Orson's arm, purpose behind it as her
apprentice addresses Bazil concerning his employer. The hand is a
reminder, and a reassurance. Jessalyn knows the time for his decision is
going to come soon, and she's released him to do that on his own. But
there's no way she can't -not- influence him. "The Empire might do the
job for you," she says flatly, an odd pessimism in her tone not really
in keeping with her usual personality. She blinks even at herself.

Orson quirks his upper lip, curling it and the soft covering of new
beard to one side. "Fair enough, I'll contact him," the man agrees.
"Anything else?" Touching the top of Jessalyn's hand, he blows out a
breath. "We've had our fair share of trouble lately. I guess you saw
about all that on Tatooine."

     "No, not right now," Bazil offers, with a smile. "And thank you. By
the by, I'll be on Caspar, in the odd event that you require any help.
I've got some contacts here, also. Just so you know, you know." He
grins, "Anything at all, just ask." And with that, he grins, and decides
that the fountain is better company than wandering.

She had started to say something, about her meeting with Bazil's agent
Rislyn, but the man's odd turn makes her think otherwise, and she clears
her throat instead, watching as the odd man heads for the fountain.
"When are you leaving, again?" Jessa asks Orson instead, turning and
leveling a worried gaze at him. "I'm suddenly not liking the idea of you
going off alone back to the base, Orson."

"Okay," Orson intones, some creeping sense of dis-ease leaving his body
as he lets out a sigh. "We've had our fair share of odd events lately,
you know. I might just take you up on that." Leveling a finger like a
blaster, Orson points it at Bazil's chest. Squinting one eye for aim, he
clicks it, thumb descending. "Same here," he adds with a little sniff,
dropping his blaster finger. Between men, this was a let's kiss and make
up moment, though they've already kissed. Bazil was on top of things.

"What?" He turns at Jessalyn, frowning. "I'm not sure, I haven't heard
about the meeting I mentioned. Not yet. Why?"

     "Right. Well. Keep in touch. I'm in my ship, in the starport. The
only matte black assault shuttle there, you know. But that's besides the
point," Bazil offers, "Keep in touch. I'll be around. If not me, than
others of my work." A wink, and he turns, and sets out for the fountain.
Sigh. So bored. So lonely. So fake. Everything! He was fake. The
universe was fake. Bah.


Jessalyn shakes her head at Orson's question, gazing at Bazil now as she
watches him turn to go, regretting that she hadn't spoken up when she
had the chance. The rattle of thoughts that bounce off him are almost
disorienting, and she shakes her head as if to clear it. "See you later,
Mr. McKenzie," she calls to his back. Then, her attention is back on her
companion. "Why? Because you're being hunted, that's why," she finally
answers once Bazil is out of earshot, the fear undisguised in her voice.

"You think I'm in danger with the organization?" Orson doesn't
completely get it, not at first. "Or you mean just travelling?" His own
mind rattles now, and he pauses to still his tangled thoughts. "I
agree," Orson says suddenly. "You're coming with me."

Orson sends through the Force...
New concern lifts in Orson's mind. Apparently her question has only now
forced him to realize what she'd be doing while he was off at some
meeting. Ash, and other dangers would stay behind, along with her.

"I -- I don't know," Jessa starts to answer. "Yes, all of those --" But
then she seems to catch something in his face, and nods her head in
vigorous agreement. "Orson, we're sort of fooling ourselves here,
really. It's not going to be safe anywhere we go. We're better off
defending each other's backs now -- especially, being so new in your
training." She seems resolved, and relieved that he has agreed with her
readily enough. "I know it won't be easy. I can hide on the ship if you
want, to keep Karrde from having a coronary," she says with a wry little
smile.


Along the side of the street, nearest to the sandbar, a single figure,
in a Caspian military uniform walks slowly along. A small astromech
droid follows slowly behind him beaping out lightly as the man slowly
nods his head.

Reaching up to scratch at his hairline, Orson lifts his shoulders. For a
second, his fingernail catches the narrow seam of his false mask, and he
wants to peel the false-skin from his face. Show his true face. But it's
not time for that. "That won't be necessary," he says, taking his hands
away. "I'm semi-content with some sorts of duplicity in my life, but not
at that level. Okay?"

"So you won't be ashamed to be seen with me?" Jessalyn asks, her voice
suddenly playful as she wraps both hands around one of Orson's arms and
leans back on her heels, smiling prettily. "Maybe we could go back to
that waterfall you took me to last time on Myrkr. Remember? Would you
like that?"

You sent through the Force to Orson...
There's a sense of relief, and Jessalyn conveys how she had feared
broaching the subject with him, even while dreading the thought of being
left behind on Caspar, considering recent events. Coupled with her more
personal and selfish desire to be near him, her guilt has paralyzed her.

The broad-shouldered man tugs her in a bit closer and starts walking a
little. "I can't promise I won't jump in this time," he muses, waving
his fingers through the air and picking up their slow walk. Aside from
all of that, he fears having to make the trip and stepping into the
darkness of that strange planet.

Tarrin nods to the pair as he walks past, not paying any attention to
what the speak of, as he continues his conversation with his droid.

Orson sends through the Force...
_You'll be safe with me_ Orson sends tentatively. A reminder. He doesn't
mean that he can protect her from anything. Just that he'll be fair to
her. Remember her, her feelings. Just that he'll be faithful.
