Players Involved: Bazil, Lelila, Enb'Zik

Bazil's Description:

        A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face,
worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of
scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his
upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn,
threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other
locations.  Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very
loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests
loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump
created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a
pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which
rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of it
is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the edges
of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas holster, in
which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming softly under
any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black leather, almost
militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no shine, and reach
nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost
scoundral-like demeanor.

Enb'Zik's Description:

==========
        The first thing almost anyone would notice upon seeing Enb'Zik is
that he isn't human. Much paler, his face is ghostly white with immense,
moist, huge eyes as black as polished obsidian and just as reflective.
Beginning on either side of his smallish nose, two pairs of skin folds
drape beneath his cheeks, covering specialized, natural air filters; one
familiar with his home planet of Sullust would recognize their
evolutionary usefulness in breathing the noxious fumes that fill that
body's atmosphere. His head is vaguely napiform, complimented by a very
prominent lower lip and large ears.
        For the time being, Enb'Zik wears a cloak made of a course,
wool-like material, probably woven from the shaggy hair of a bantha or
some similarly pelted creature. Whatever color it originally held, the
garb is now dyed into a deep shade of forest green, reminiscent of the
shadowy, middle canopy somewhere on the forest world of Kashyyyk. Beneath
that top layer of verdant pigmentation is a second robe of medium brown.
All of it is tied at the waist, and the hem of the garment hangs almost to
the Sullustan's finely shod feet.
        The entire outfit gives the feeling of casual comfort combined
with nicety and good mannerism. Full ranges of motion are easily allowed
as the pallid humanoid travels about or extends his arms in whatever
gesticulations seem natural. Billowy folds of fabric surround his arms and
legs.
==========

Lelila's Description:

Here stands a young woman, about 24 years old and looking to be probably
5'5 in height. She has jade colored eyes that are almost covered by a
shaggy bang, her hair is raven black and goes around her head in a neatly
done braid. Lelila is wearing a simple dark green jumpsuit, which is the
basic uniform of a New Republic A-wing pilot. The suit has numerous
pockets to allow her to store items. Across her upper left-chest area is a
dull-gray namepatch with the name L. Jayespyer imprinted on it. Under her
nametag her rank is displayed as Lt. Commander. Her left shoulder has a
squadron patch shaped as an emerald green letter 'A'. A silver bowcaster
is set in the lower left of the green letter with twelve miniature A-wings
being 'fired' in V formation towards the upper right. On her right
shoulder is the familiar red Phoenix crest of the New Republic.  On her
feet are gray deck shoes, she doesn't care to wear heavy boots when she
doesn't have to. She only wears two pieces of jewelry, the only items she
owns. The first is a round locket that is hidden under the neck of her
jumpsuit. The second is a heart shaped pendant on a chain- all done in
gold. This she keeps fully visible.

==LOG BEGINS==

Lelila nods and also looks for a Cantina, the spaceport wasn't the
greatest place to talk, especally that the busy hour it was in. "About
that, and this is about the only place outside of the Delverance, that we
are allowed to go. But I can understand, it's been pretty tense these last
few months..."

Enb'Zik has a good idea exactly WHY it's been tense and nods. Perfect
chance to bring up a subject that's been on his mind, but not the best
place for it. He decides on the idea that both of them are thinking,
"Hey.. Fancy a bottle of water somewhere?" The Sullustan equivalent of a
grin crosses his face upon mentioning the running joke between the two.

"Just what I was going to suggest, there is a place around here, some of
the best bottled water around." Lelila suggests andstarts walking in that
direction gesturing for Enb'Zik to follow.

A small planetary transport shuttle touches down nearby, it's hatch
quickly opening. After a brief moment, out steps a civvy dressed man. He
makes his way away from the shuttle, his eyes peering at a datapad held in
his hands. He keeps a single eye out for where he goes, his direction more
or less towards a pair of beings; a Sullustan, and once fellow pilot of
his, Lelila. He doesn't show any hint of noticing them, but Lelila would
probably most definately recognize him as XO of Ghost Squadron.

"Sounds great," follows the slightly accented voice of Enb'Zik. He weaves
around a pair of humans as they nearly bump into him while moving cargo on
an anti-grav sled. Zik doesn't seem particularly concerned with the fact
that neither seemed to notice him and continues in Lelila's wake.
"Perfect, in fact," he offers. Now that they're moving, it's more
difficult for others to follow their conversation, "So, how are things
with the Archer Squadron?"

Archer? Well, if that doesn't catch Bazil's attention. He looks up from
his datapad, catches sight of Lelila, and a grin passes over his face.
Quickening his pace slightly, he makes his best attempt at catching up
with the pair, the other one he only vaguely recognizes from the swoop
races. "Hey Archer, slow up for a fellow pilot, eh?" he calls out to the
two.

Lelila turns and finally notices Bazil, she had seem him only briefly in
the mess hall since his return, and smiles with a nod at him, "Sorry
didn't see you back there, we're trying to find a cantina or something
around here, and I'm having a bit of trouble remembering the way." She
looks a little embarassed, but that soon passes.

At the sound of Bazil's unfamiliar voice, Enb'Zik pauses with Lelila and
watches the man with hidden curiousity. Not recognizing the human, Zik
looks on while Bazil catches up. Pleasantly, the Sullustan glances at
various faces in the crowd, recognizing none.

"Quite alright, Lelila... sorry I didn't stop to say hi on the Del last
night. My new work has been keeping me quite occupied." Bazil finally
catches up, and grins, "A cantina? Well... there's this fancy schmancy
nightclub off to th' west...  the only other one I know is a dangerous
underground establishment down there." He points over between the darker
lower levels of the city, "But, if you go there, we'd better be armed and
willing for a fight." A small shrug is procured from his vast supply, and
offered to the pair.

"Yeah that's understandable...oh another thing I forgot, Bazil this is
Enb'Zik, a old friend of mine from Caspar, Enb'zik this is Bazil, former
XO of Ghost Squadron." Lelila wish that quick introduction goes back to
the topic at hand, "Lead the way, I'm up for a little adventure, how about
you Zik?" She chuckles and had been there once before, though she can't
remember why...

Enb'Zik laughs, "Well, my bodyguard is off duty, but sure. Why not?"
Looking over to Bazil, the Sullustan offers a nod of greeting and extends
a beige skinned hand, "A pleasure to meet you, Bazil." He smiles, "Ghost
Squadron, huh? The X-Wing is a good fighter." As the trio walks along one
of the thoroughfares, a steady buzz of conversations is overlain only by
the low howling of wind through the durasteel canyons between the
buildings.

The former pilot extends his own hand, and shakes the Sullstan's, offering
up a generic greeting in the being's own language, albeit not perfectly,
giving hint to someone used to being around such a race, but not
extensively. "Bazil McKenzie, and the pleasure is all mine. I've heard of
your racings... a pity you haven't raced recently." He smiles, taking his
own hand back, "And yes, she is. A pity I don't fly them officially
anymore... I've moved onto a more lucrative occupation." Slowly, the pilot
turns a hand down to his Kylan-3 at his side, and checking the charge,
"Well, I'm all set...  just a word of advice, keep to the lighter areas."
He motions towards one of the elevator trams that beckons along a row of
buildings, which leads down into the darkness below.

"Right, lead the way Bazil..." Lelila follows behind the former pilot, and
would have kept her eyes open even with his warning, however a slight
smile does creep onto her face.

Either Enb'Zik isn't carrying a blaster, or he's already confident
regarding the charge of whatever he IS carrying. "I'm with you, as well,"
he comments, ready to head down into the seedier areas of the city-planet.
"How far down are we going, anyway?" The Sullustan is far more comfortable
fighting behind the stick of a starship, but being in the Marines left him
trustful of his hand-to-hand abilities in a pinch.

"Near the bottom of the city, or something like that. It's far enough down
that no sunlight /ever/ reaches it, at any rate..." Bazil steps inside the
lift, taps at the console, and it whisks the trio down to the depths of
the city, the light growing dimmer and dimmer as they go...

Great. Mid-level is one thing, but near the bottom?? Things down here that
were once human aren't even human any more. The beings this far down in
the bowels of Coruscant are the things childrens' stories are made of; the
kind of story used to scare kids into good behavior. Glancing around
himself and noticing Bazil's action, Enb'Zik considers following suit and
decides to do so. No use in having his weapon caught in the folds of his
cloak if he needs it. Moving a hand to the side of his outer garment, he
moves a latch and takes off that layer, letting the cloak fall into his
left hand to reveal a Kylan holstered against his right thigh.

Lelila doesn't seem to be too worried, even though she is wearing her
uniform (why...I didn't think I would be going to the bottom of Coruscant
today...) and her blaster is back on the ship, (like that would help
ether, I couldn't shoot a Hutt). So she sticks close to the other two in
the group and continues to keep her eyes open.

Definately not a casual stroll through the park, Bazil adjusts the DD6 he
just strapped at his waist, checking it's charge as well. Not only that,
but he constantly keeps an eye out for anything around, his eyes darting
around the area continuously. Sounds of the dark usher forth; a scream
quite a ways off, the patter of hidden feet, the occasional rustle in the
shadows... well, it's been a while since Bazil has taken a stroll here,
and that was with a heavily armed bodyguard.  Nearby, a soft rustle in the
shadows causes the pilot to cock an eye in that direction, a confident
frown coveting his face.

There are advantages to growing up as a cave dweller -- it leaves one with
excellent night vision, and this far down, that's a bonus. With shadows
probably more easily revealed to him than the others, Enb'Zik glances in
the direction of the rustling and narrows his eyes a bit before looking
sideways and noting that Bazil is already alerted to the same thing. This
is tense enough without problems. The Sullustan smirks to himself,
wondering why he never has Snarl around when the fun happens. High above,
at the top of the deep chasm, red lights flash on the wingtips of a
thousand ships in the Coruscanti atmosphere.

Lelila hasn't heard anything yet...but she notices the other two tense,
and she looks around, she might have liked to borrow some of Enb'Zik's
night vision,she can't see a dang thing, just at the moment when she
needed to...

"You catch that, Zik?" Bazil inquires to the Sullustan near him quietly,
as he shifts the arm of his shirt slowly, masking his intricate actions as
adjusting the fabric. He moves his eyes away from the source of the
rustling, albeit he does keep an ear cocked to the situation. "Lelila,
come here... lemme lend ya a blaster..." he offers in whispered tones,
holding his wrist casually.

"Mmhmmm," comes the Sullustan's reply, offerred at the same volume as the
question that initiated it. "Twi'lek," he adds in the hushed tone. Turning
his eyes forward, he finds the apparent entrance to their destination some
thirty meters away -- too far to easily get there within a few seconds.
The Sullustan chews the inside of his lip before a second sound catches
his ear, arriving from a source different from the first.

Lelila tries her best to silently move over to Bazil to get the blaster,
while still trying to see what this threat is. She whispers holding out
her hand to Bazil, "Quickly, I think whoever it is, is getting closer."

In a swift yet subtle gesture, a C411 hold-out appears from Bazil's
sleeve, held unclasped in a black nylon wrist holster, designed for easy
release in tight situations. Deftly, he slips the tiny blaster to the
woman, before moving his own hand down to the Kylan at his waist, and
unclasping the strap that holds it firmly in place. Slowly, his hand
brushes back and forth over the handle, confidently. His other arm lies
within reach of the second blaster he bears, his military-issue DD6.  
This would have been a wonderful time to bring his old stash, in that stow
bag. Figures, that he'd leave that jewel aboard his ship... "I can call in
a transport... but it will take at least a couple minutes to get here."
The words are ushered to them both, hushed to keep the intent concealed.
More sounds, from several different places all around.

Lelila nods only a second of thanks to Bazil and grips the blaster as she
steps back over behind Zik, as it stood even with 
the blaster she was pretty helpless. The sign over the doorway of the
cantina glowed so close...but it wasn't close enough 
for her.

Enb'Zik shakes his head, "No good. This far down, you would have to have
one hegk of a bilot to get here. The wind sheers between those buildings
are murderous, and the walls are too close for gomfort." Sullustan accent
thickening slightly with the situation, he glances skyward for a very
brief timespan while leaving his peacestrap in place for a moment or two
longer. The harsh glare of an advertisement glints from a silvery
attachment on his left boot, revealing some type of enclosure, most likely
for another, unidentified weapon. "Geep walking, I think. The entrance is
gloser than going back the way we came, netzt?"

"Aye. At least there, if a firefight ensues, we'll have some support. The
Black Sun and local slumlife get along well enough... but they don't like
to cross each other." Clack, clack, clack, comes forth from a shadow, and
out steps a Noghri, bearing a pair of medium-sized vibroblades. Following
that comes several other beings... the Twi'lek, who carries an antiquaited
gas-propelled shotgun, and a heavily scarred, average height human, with a
wicked looking vibro-axe, and a small blaster. The dark keeps their faces
mostly hidden from view... from the angle of approach, they leave both
departure to the north, and continuing on to the bar possible...

"Great looking crowd we're about to run into." Lelila mutters under her
breath to no one but herself, though she thought it would be a joy getting
out of this place, as much as it was getting in, 'well here is your
adventure for today, Lel- enjoy it.'

"Kechatr," murmurs Enb'Zik, a mild Sullustan explicative of botheredness.
The human and the Twi'lek don't particularly worry him; they're typically
clumsy, untrained, and not worth being concerned over. That Noghri,
though.. that's a different story. Frowning, Enb'Zik presses a pair of
buttons in sequence on a chronometer attached to his left wrist. A muted
blue light appears on the device and reflects from his obsidian eyes as he
raises it to his mouth. Just loudly enough to be heard, he speaks, "Gamma
team, we're almost in position. Have your snipers stay alert. Looks like
there could be trouble.  Alpha two, out." Of course, there is no Gamma
Team, and there are no snipers, but the three troublemakers don't know
that.  Enb'Zik glances toward his two compatriots, locking short but
meaningful glances.

The message at first doesn't seem to bother the trio, except possibly the
human, who glance at his fellow slummers. Bazil drops to one knee on the
ground, slipping the Kylan out of his holster, and pointed it carefully
towards the Twi'lek. He knows far better than to tempt fate directly with
the Noghri first; besides, it's not the one that could kill him with a
twitch of finger. His other hand slips a comlink out of his other sleeve,
and he pushes it to his face, "Forest, eta on that transport?" His voice
sounds almost annoyed, as he waits a moment. Suddenly, strangely enough, a
response comes, "Uhh...  chief... we've got another few minutes here...
maybe more..." The voice is male, well spoken basic. The pilot slips his
comlink onto his cuff, and draws the other blaster, pointing it carefully
towards the Human. The stance is strange, but deliberate. A defensive
position that would allow him to roll away from blaster fire, and fire off
rapid shots if needed.

Lelila follows suit and does everything not to stand there looking
confused, what were they doing? Gamma team, the transport? She was sure
they had decided against that route. She shoots Zik in front of her a
meaning ful glance as well and just goes with whatever is going to come
through. Keeping her hand tight on her blaster even more still.

As smoothly as possible, Enb'Zik slips his own Three from its holster, the
strap falling easily to one side to release the sidearm. A pallid, tan
thumb slips across a button next to the trigger, disengaging the weapon's
safety mechanism. Noticing the human's subtle show of doubt, the Sullustan
picks him out as the most likely to flee under pressure and levels the
Kylan's barrel squarely at his chest. His expression is firm, and his lips
now offer nothing but silence as he stares the man directly in the eyes.

Well, the human definately doesn't seem to happy about his situation now,
especially with two blasters pointed straight at him. Even the Twi'lek
seems to falter slightly, eyes flicking over to the Noghri, as if
searching for a reason to stay. The human doesn't find that reason, so he
turns and flees from the area, back into the shadows someplace.
Unfortunately for him, the shadows take any kindness on those who run,
which will probably mean certain death for him in a day or two if the two
remaining survive. The Twi'lek takes a single step back, and Bazil keeps
his sights on him, whilst moving the other blaster over to the final
remaining...

Lelila frowns both outwardly and inwardly, she can see from the corner of
her eye Bazil pointing his blaster at the Nogri...even he couldn't be that
stupid, there was no way. Though she keeps her eye on the Nogri's
movements to see what he was going to, he certanally wouldn't run like the
other two, or would he?

"Gamma Team, one down. Keep your sights on the two that are left," Enb'Zik
mutters, "But hold your fire." At least that will explain why they aren't
shooting. If the three are going to use that ruse, they may as well get it
to last long enough to work. The Sullustan shifts his aim in the Twi'lek's
direction. Three guns on the blue-skinned tail-header should have him
running within seconds, leaving the Noghri solo. Still, it's not
particularly honorable to run, and knowing the Noghri race's fielty to
that concept, it could be a problem. The pale pilot steels himself for the
possible confrontation as he braces his aim at the tallest assailant's
anemic gut.

Most of the Twi'lek's that Bazil knows or knew wouldn't have lasted ten
seconds under such pressure. Let alone three blasters. Finally, he gives,
and slowly backs away, letting out a slow hiss as he disappears under the
cover of shadows, making a point not to turn his back upon his final
counterpart. The one that now stands in an offensive position, both
vibro-weapons drawn and whirring in a high pitched tone. The trio's ploy
has worked so far, and all it needs is the final touch. Slowly, the human
pilot turns his second blaster towards the Noghri's body, keeping the more
accurate on it's head, the less on it's gut. A small gust of wind courses
through the area, sending some scraps of lightweight garbage coarsing over
the ground, a single sheet managing to catch upon one of Zik's feet for a
tiny moment, before it floats off again.

"Two down, Gammas. I think we can handle it from here, but maintain
position." Enb'Zik turns his eyes toward the Noghri and falls silent
again. A showdown of three-to-one would typically be easy fare, but even
Zik doesn't like those odds with a hunter-killer of this type. He clenches
his teeth and reminds himself of the species' speed; he'll need to lead
the target quickly if he has to shoot. Somewhere in the back of his mind,
he wonders whether that transport really is on its way, or if Bazil is
bluffing as much as Enb'Zik was.

Well, as if answering the Sullustan's thoughts, a soft thrumming comes
over the sounds of the city at night, and all at once, piercing light
shines forth around the street, slicing through the shadows with intensity
of fire to silk. Several other beings seem to have been perched around in
the shadows, observing the action, and they quickly scurry away and out of
the light, like cockroaches under a flashlight. The light's source begins
to lower itself, and Bazil grins to himself softly, "Never underestimate
New Republican pilots, Zik." Keeping his guns trained on the Noghri, who
now seems to be quite a bit more nervous than before, the civvy clad pilot
stands slowly. The transport, entirely black, with only the crest of the
Republic borne on it's body, sets down right in the middle of the street,
behind the trio of pilots, between them and the bar, leaving the Noghri,
who stays quite in the same stance, a solitary chance for escape.

"Impressive. Most impressive." With the confirmed knowledge that Bazil is
NR military, Enb'Zik stands as well and begins backing toward the shuttle
craft. "Certainly the most exciting glass of water I've ever stopped for.
Reaching the entrance to the transport, the Sullustan posts himself to the
left of the door and awaits the other two. When he landed on Coruscant
earlier this evening, he certainly hadn't had this in mind.

Lelila blinks and this time does turn around to look at Bazil...he wasn't
bluffing. She murmers still watching to see what the Nogri was going to
do, "No never underestimate Bazil..." She gives them both a look as if to
say, 'What are we going to do now?' And vaugly wonders if they were going
to actually get into the Cantina...she spots Zik getting into the
transport and shakes her head, question answered.

"Sorry, guys... we can grab some refreshments aboard the transport, after
we get past the bumpy part." Bazil offers, backing away towards the craft,
whilest the Noghri decides to seat himself at the edge of the street,
content that his prey are retreating. Slowly, the beast strikes his
still-activated blades against the hard ground, leaving deep marks in
place. "Rule number one down here for me: Always keep your comlink on and
transmitting," Bazil starts as he slides the hatch entrance open, and
offers a hand to Lelila, for assistance in entering, "I had to do this
once before in this same place... only last time was during a firefight
with some unruly citizens." His eyes glance around, the pair of blasters
now loosely reholstered. The gun turret on the vehicle slowly turns, with
a spotlight, with a second solemnly fixeated on the Noghri.

With the others getting inside the transport, Enb'Zik drops his Kylan into
its holster, grabs onto the handle built just inside the ingress hatch,
and hauls himself up into the interior. "Good thinking," he replies on his
way in. I'd also like to meet the man piloting this vessel, is his next
thought. Offering a glance forward, Enb'Zik makes note of the pilot's and
co-pilot's faces before moving to let Bazil in so that the craft can lift
off.

Lelila takes Bazil's hand and gets into the transport behind Zik, "And you
see why I left FLS for this?" Once inside she removes her grip from the
blaster and waits until Bazil is in to give it back to him, "I owe my
thanks to both of you, now I know why I haven't been down here in quite
some time..."

Bazil steps inside himself, tapping the door shut, and heading towards the
front of the vehicle, patting the pilot on his shoulder, "Good job,
Forest. You were faster than last time." The man, Forest, is trussed in an
entirely black uniform, with a solitary republic crest on his shoulder, as
well as a simple crest below that, which includes the letters NRI. As for
the vehicle itself, it looks quite paramilitary in design, militaristic
harneses along rows of seats, obviously designed for some sort of
quick-response team. Rows of empty racks are in the center, as well as
various other gear racks, all empty. He utters to the black clad pilots
again, "Let's get out of here. His friends will probably be back soon."

Enb'Zik's glossy eyes have been taking in his surroundings since he
finished boarding, and the NRI logo didn't escape his attention. Casting a
look toward Bazil, Enb'Zik drops into one of the seats and begins
fastening one of the belts even as the ship begins lifting off. With the
amount of wind sheer blowing between these buildings, any pilot would
recognize the potential for immense turbulence. While the vagabond threat
might be dealt with, the five pilots aren't out of danger just yet.

Lelila takes a seat as well and looks out the darkend windows, not exactly
the kind of day she had planned out, but interesting none the less. She
fastens her belt as well and realizes she still has the blaster in her
hand, she decides to wait until this whole mess is over before giving it
back to Bazil. "Not exactly a normal night, but interesting." She says to
no one in particular, a smile back on her face.

As the ship continues to ascend, Enb'Zik leans back in the shock chair and
tries to make himself comfortable in spite of a sudden lurch that takes
place before the shuttle again smooths its flight path. "New Republic
Intelligence," he remarks.  Shaking his head, he seems mildly surprised,
"I certainly would not have expected the evening to turn out like this."
He looks toward Bazil, then to Lelila, "You mentioned tension aboard the
Deliverance earlier tonight.. I am guessing that was in conjunction with
the Death Star that rumors have been flying about?"
