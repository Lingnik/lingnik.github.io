<div class="content">
<p>Log Date: May 22, 2000</p>
<p>People Involved: Vauki, Mersche, Xanatos, Casperian Command</p>
<p>Synopsis: After some time on Caspar, trying to unravel anything that might
be known there, the team decides to leave.  After a short decision, they
make a course for Cochran, the homeworld of the Griffon Alliance, hoping
to meet up with a military man named Patricio Rey.</p>
<p>Background: The team had thus far spent several days on Caspar, setting up
contacts there, meeting with several officials, and assigning liasons to
the Casperian government, as well as the Republic's Diplomatic
corps.  Finally, the group gets fed up there, and decides to do
something...</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Vauki saunters into the cockpit, reading over a datapad slowly. The
blaster is no long attached at his waist, and he seems a bit more awake
and attentive than usual.</p>
<p>Mersche is reading a book... well, what can be called a book, its a
compilation of opaque white pages of flimsiplast with text on it. Looks
more like a bunch of info rather than a novel. Her legs are taking up both
her seat and the one beside her, and she seems intent on reading and
nothing much else.</p>
<p>"We're leaving. Xanatos just got back." Mege's words are simple, his
explanation even more so. He tosses the datapad on one of the consoles,
and taps the entry hatch closed. A shorter visit than usual for him, but
still too long in terms of their mission...</p>
<p>Xanatos moves onto the Bridge, tapping a data-pad against his hand in a
thoughtful manner. "Yes, I've returned." He states, "From what I've found,
going to CSA probably wouldn't be a good idea. The Griffons are supposed
to have positive relations with us right now, and we could speak with one
Evan Decker to get more information about them. Caspar is a possibility,
but not as strong,"</p>
<p>Mersche looks over from her reading and sits up straight, "So we're off to
Griffon territory, then?" she asks setting down her book of flimsiplast
and swivelling her chair in the direction of the navigational computer.</p>
<p>Vauki leans over to one of the computer consoles, swivelling the ajoining
chair out of the way. He quickly taps in the name, as a list of possible
matches come up on screen, and then are narrowed down to a single woman.
Miss Evan Decker, Diplo Attache. "Decker's on leave at the moment...
unknown location." He closes the file, stands, and leans on the chair
softly, "Griffon territory..." The words are echoed, before he says,
"Yeah. Let's go. You got the coords?" He himself wanders over to the
copilot's seat, tapping in a quick set of commands himself, reading
through the various ship status fields. His eyes don't even pass over his
fingers as they move rapidly across the console.</p>
<p>Mersche says, "Depends. What planet do we want?"</p>
<p>"Getting ahold of one of thier Intelligence agents is going to be tricky."
The Tw'lek slips down into a passanger's chair, "That, I'm not sure on."</p>
<p>Vauki pauses in his tappings at the console, as he tries to recall some
sort of information, "Where... Cochran, I believe.  You got the
coordinates for it?" He stops his console-tapping entirely, and swivels in
his seat to grab his small datapad.  Reading over it quickly, he reassures
himself over some recent information, "Oh... by the way: The Imperial
prisoner from the Angry Rancor was interrogated last night... she didn't
know anything. Seems Mr. Valak didn't even trust his personal
hand-maidens. She knew about it, though." He frowns, and slowly places the
pad down again, "They couldn't get anything else out of here. Even with
Master Skywalker's assistance." His assumption, of course, is that
everyone knows who the Republic's favourite Jedi is.</p>
<p>"Mr. Valak... personal hand-maidens... " The Twi'lek questions, "I think I
must have missed something in the reports." He slips the data-pad he was
tapping against his wrist into a pocket, before yawning.</p>
<p>Mersche nods, "I've got Cochran in the ship's computer... got to launch
first." she says simply.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7584 has just entered the system at 155,47,-85.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-4333 -- "This is the CMS
Typhoon. Please identify yourself and your intentions in system."</p>
<p>Vauki sits back in the copilot's seat again, peering at Mersche for a
moment, before looking out the fore windoe. He patiently waits to see that
she sends a message off in response.</p>
<p>Mersche mutters.</p>
<p>"Want me to take care of control, Mer?" His tone is simple, and
questioning. "I used to live here.. I know how to get past them with
ease."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-4333: "Greetings CMS Typhoon. This is
the YT-1300 _Triton_. We were just on Caspar in a meeting and were about
to leave. Can we help you with something?"</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From CS-4333 over frequency 3000.00: "Control to Triton.
Further assistance is not needed. What is your destiantion?""</p>
<p>Mersche says, "Think they'll care if we tell them Cochran?"</p>
<p>Xanatos says, "I don't see why the would?"</p>
<p>Vauki frowns, pondering for a moment, "Go ahead. Caspar and the Griffons
are in treaty. I just hope no Imps are listening in..."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-4333: "We're going to Cochran, CMS
Typhoon."</p>
<p>Mersche says, "Let's just hope the Imperials are stupid today."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From CS-4333 over frequency 3000.00: "Control to Triton.
You are clared for depature thank yo ufor your cooepration."</p>
<p>Xanatos raises an eyebrow. "Unless know who this ship belongs to, I don't
believe the Imperials would much care."</p>
<p>Vauki sighs softly, "With the way things are looking, and with Emperor
Valak in charge, I don't know that the Empire is as much stupid as they
were five years ago. They've had time to analyze their weaknesses, and
Valak is no fool. He knows how to run it."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-4333: "Of course, CMS Typhoon. Thank
you for caring." Mersche engages the hyperdrive. Mersche smiles silently.</p>
<p>::: After a short stunt at Cochran, the team met up with the officials
there, and were pointed towards Pride 1, the Griffon's own space station,
to meet with someone called Patricio Rey...</p>
