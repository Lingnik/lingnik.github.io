<h1 id="Whyisthatfleetthere36">2007-06-16: Why is that fleet there?</h1>
<p>&lt;SPACE> With all the grace of a gnat flying into a forcefield, a light gray largely modified assault shuttle *POP*s out of hyperspace with a brilliant flash, the trail of her visage stretching backwards into the dark of the perpetual night sky of space. Shields down and weapons not nearly threatening, the ship glides on her own for a moment's passing until her pilot, finally bothering to look outside the transparisteel canopied windows of the bridge, comes to the sudden realization that despite his best knowledge, the ensemble of ships before him was not, in fact, one of Rebel or even an independent source, but was, in fact, belonging to the Empire.</p>
<p>An ordinary man, confronted with such a revelation, and expecting the opposite, would normally turn and run. The Dirty Jawa's pilot, though, is not at all an ordinary man, and does quite the unexpected, if still deliberate, action, and simply keeps on going, staring dumbstruck at the collection of ships. The ship, content due to various regimes of physics, continues on its way without a care in the world towards the rather large, and rather ominous, collection of Imperial vessels and the planet they protect.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> One of those ships, easily distinguishable from the others surrounding the planet by it's size, turns about with a ponderous motion before making it's way toward the newly arrived assualt shuttle. A severly official male voice comes through the comm speaker on the flight console of the Dirty Jawa as the Star Destroyer Inquisitor moves closer. "Attention,  unidentified ship. You are now in Imperial controlled space and are ordered to stop all engines and weapons and prepare for boarding."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The pilot of The Dirty Jawa stares out at the window of his ship towards the encroaching Star Destroyer with faint trepidation. His hands hover over the controls of his ship, as that ship continues slowly drifting towards the Destroyer. Beside him a droid chitters at the navigation console in an agitated fashion, also obviously concerned about the presence of the Empire. His hand taps the communications controls finally, eyes still fixed outside, "Your message was confirmed. Applying engines to stop, and disengaging all power to weapons systems. My docking hatch is at your disposal."</p>
<p>Clipping a comlink to his collar, the pilot stands from his console, leaving the droid to handle the busy-work, and heads for the rear of the ship. The Dirty Jawa momentarily continues, then comes to a stop, its power systems dipping some to account for the shutdown of weapons. Lights flicker on throughout the ship, ushering from the windows.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Star Destroyer comes to a slow halt as the Dirty Jawa also stops it's own forward progress as the voice from before emerges from the comm unit again. "Message recieved..we are dispatching an assualt shuttle to your position now. Have all pertinent documents available for inspection." As these words are spoken the gunmental gray armor of the assualt shuttle appears before turning toward the Dirty Jawa's position and, within several minutes, the shuttle is docked alongside and there is a knock upon the interior hatch leading into the Dirty Jawa's interior.</p>
<p>Keline pages: Would his personal documents show he used to work for NRI or would there be some sort of cover story?
You paged Keline with 'He doesn't have the resources or facilities to come up with false documents, but any documents wouldn't identify specifically that he worked for NRI. The Empire should know, however, that a Bazil McKenzie did work for NRI and was an Inner Councilor for the NR. They might also have access to knowledge that he resigned in 10ABY. Anything after that is conjecture unless you have systems that flag me for something after that. Most of his current papers would identify him as being independently aligned and coming from Tatooine and Corellia, but identifying him accurately as Bazil, who the Empire has dealt with in the past, and rarely positively.'</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> There is a hiss of pressure equalization as the interior hatch of The Dirty Jawa's starboard-side docking port opens into the hull. The entry nexus from the airlock is cramped. To the left a blast-door is opened onto what looks like empty crew quarters, and the cargo bay behind that. To the right, a bare-plate-metal auxiliary lift and stairwell, behind which lies a door to service areas and the gunnery wells. The room is drab, with a few pressure suites on the wall, atmospheric facemasks, and a scant little else.</p>
<p>The somewhat disturbing visage of Bazil stands there, in the center of the room, wearing basic clothes and no weapons, his hands placid at his sides, one holding a small packet of documents. No one else appears in this room, or, as it would appear, anywhere else on the ship. "Hi," He says, to the freshly opened hatch.</p>
<p>Bazil:
        The being that stands before you is an ephereal juxtaposition of life; something that appears as if it should not
 be alive, yet challenges every belief there-to. Standing average height for most humanoids, reddish-brown short hair, thin but unwavering, presses upwards. Where once were fine features and daunting scars now lay a mottled and damaged facade. Entire sections of skin have gone missing from his face, revealing a matte metallic undersurface in places, firmly attached to bone, scratched and worn. Where skin does reside still, it is grim and tender, seeming to have been dealt serious burns and healed since. His neck is almost completely intact. Eyes are livid with life, however; about the only pure sign that he is, indeed, alive; they nearly glow in their hazel depths.
        His body is clad simply. A tunic covers his upper body down to his mid-arms, where the shirt has been rolled up to reveal sinewy black and gray metallic arms for both. His replacement exoskeleton has none of the fleshly appeal it should, and is naked to the elements. The metallic bones are pitted and scratched, having endured serious damage. They still function. Within the hollow junctions of the left arm, a silvery chain has been intertwined, a small pendant dangling out but an inch&#8212;a sandy-colored eye-shaped piece, surrounded by two opposing wings; one the blue of a night's sky, the other a deep burgundy like magma. His legs are covered in similar material to the tunic. Black boots clad his feet.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Outside the Dirty Jawa's hand stand a uniformed lieutenant, two stromtroopers, and a scanning team at the back of the little gathering. These last two remain behind as the lieutenant and the troopers, all ignoring Bazil's greeting. The lieutenant studies him for a moment before holding out a hand as he looks Bazil in the eye. "Your papers, please."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Bazil's response is simple. His eyes meet the lieutenant's, his face expressionless, but not agitated, agitational, or otherwise unduly agitating. He steps forward, and place the papers in the lieutenant's hand with his own wretched and wrecked hand, the sinewy metal fingers emitting a soft whirring as he releases them, and as he drops his arm the small chained trinket in the metal bones clatters around gently.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> With the air of someone who has done this so many time that he has become inured to the process, metal exoskeleton or no, he slides the datacard into the slot of his datapad and begins to scan through the information as it scrowls along the screen while addressing Brazil without actually looking at him, but it should be known that the troopers haven't averted their gaze from Brazil. "What is your purpose in this system? Do you have any cargo? Passengers?"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> "I had property on the planet six or seven years ago," Bazil responds in kind, "In the Menrai district. I'm here to see if I still hold claim to it. The papers for that are there as well," his finger pointing to what the lieutenant holds, "I have no cargo for trade but my equipment, belongings, and droid are all aboard. I have some weapons, and no passengers."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The lieutenant turns and gestures the scanner techs forward before he turns back to Brazil. "Your weapons will have be to scanned and logged before being allowed onto the planet along with your ship and it's contents. Your person will recieve a more thorough search upon reaching the planet." *The lieutenant looks down at the datapad as the device emits a beep and he glances odwn at it in response. "It also seems you've had a rather..checkered background.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> "Of course," Bazil replies to the first, "They're in a locker on the floor above us, in the common room. The droid has one in his storage bay. I have one on my person right now. " He pauses, as the datapad is examined again. "Yes," Comes his honest response, "I resigned from my posts in the New Republic Intelligence and Inner Council six years ago, as that ought to reveal. I was with the Republic when it resisted the Empire's last retaking of Coruscant, and paid dearly for it. I would consent to any questions you see fit as to ask, though anything I know now is outdated and useless, or otherwise known to those who interrogated me when I was last in Imperial custody, and also any actions I took part in are irrespective of my current allegiances, which are no longer to the New Republic. I have been on Tatooine and Corellia for my own affairs since then.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Lieutenant nods at the techs again they begin to make their way off the bridge to begin to check out the rest of the ship, one of the troopers accompanying them, as the other stays with the lieutenant as the officer listens to what he has to say as he nods with an apperance that suggests some approval. "So our records show...your status is beyond my power to approve or decline. You will be allowed to the planet, but once you are there your ship will be placed in lockdown while your background is investigated. You will then be released." *he withdraws the documentation Bazil provided before he hands it back to him.* "What were you doing on Tatooine and Corellia?"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> "I understand." Bazil's face follows the scanner crew for a moment before his eyes return to meet those of the Lieutenant's. He takes his papers back. "I operated an orphanage on Tatooine until recently, and my sister, Jasmine Heretin, is a doctor and benefactor of a hospital on Corellia." In fact more than one hospital, but rather a chain of them. His own twin brother, Adian Ward, having foreshadowed Bazil's life, led NRI and then vanished, though Adian had yet to be heard from in some time.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The lieutenant nods again as he flicks on his communicatior before getting in touch with the scanning team. "Come back to the bridge; the scan will be peformed on planet." *he then looks at Bazil again and nods. "Commenable. I'm sure your problems on planet will be few if your story checks out." Just then scanning team shows up and the lieutenant salutes and they begin to make their way off the ship.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> "I hope so," comes Bazil's voice. "Thank you for your time." He continues to stand there, waiting in the nexus to close the hatch behind the boarding party.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The hatch does close, and then the shuttle clears from the Dirty Jawa and makes it way back to the Star Destroyer. The voice from the Star Destroyer that was heard at first comes back through the comm speaker. "You are cleared to descend. Follow landing beacon 113-A to Planetary Control spaceport."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Dirty Jawa's engines come back online, and thrust her towards the planet in an effort to land, "Confirmed, control." With a sudden thrust from her engines, she bursts towards the planet in a deliberate vector, headed for the indicated beacon. Within minutes, she is shuddering through the atmosphere towards the spaceport.</p>
