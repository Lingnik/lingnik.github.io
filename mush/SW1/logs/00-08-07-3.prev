<p>Log Date: August 7, 2000</p>
<p>Players Involved: Sargent, Bazil</p>
<p>Bazil's Description:</p>
<p>Standing fully at a rather average height for a human, this man
imposes a calm and simple appearance. Fair skin, marked with several small
scars darts his face, very little in the way of other blemishes marking
him. His hair is a lightened brown, freshly cut, and waving unkempt around
his head, just short enough to stay away from his brows and ears.  Brown
eyes match the hair, slight tints of yellow streaming through in tiny
intricate designs, completely natural. His brows and lashes are a dark
black, well kept, except for the brows, which flow forth from just above
the edges of his eyes, tapering back into a diluted point. Soft dark
shadows covet themselves beneath the globes, circles just slightly visible
before they fade out of existance halfway past his eyes. The nose is
simple, and unpronounced, the sides slightly poking out from the rest of
the roundish figure. No facial hair is borne over his face: his chin,
lips, and beneath ears kept well shaven. Simple, yet full, lips cover his
face, the only other noticible facial feature on him. The rest of his body
is kept in well shape, from what can be seen. Musculature on his body is
kept to a minimum, though well defined and toned to meager strength.</p>
<p>The man is clothed in simple and unpronounced apparel, completely
black in design. Midnight slacks tightly press against his legs and waist,
flexing to his every movement, and letting no crease through. A belt
around his waist holds the very pants up, whilst providing a place for
various items attached there. The only things definately noticible there
consisting of a datapad, held in place with a simple T-shaped strap, and a
Kylan-3 'Hand-Cannon' blaster, kept in it's place with a black holster,
prominantly displayed to all. Black military-style leather boots cover his
feet, the tops unseen under the lower regions of his pants. His upper body
is covered in a shirt, in the same fabric of the pants, tight fitting, and
simple. The only markings consist of a New Republic patch on his left
shoulder, a nametag on his left breast reading 'Bazil McKenzie' with the
word 'Chief' and seven dark grey-silvery bars below, and a branch patch on
his right breast&#8212;a blue bar, with a wave-like texture, the red NR phoenix
emblazoned upon it, and the three letters 'NRI' raised in grey upon that.</p>

<p>Sargent's Description:</p>
<p>You see a young human woman in her mid to early 20's. Her frame
is thin and compact, and her body has a vertical extent of no more than
1.5 meters. She has a well-cropped mop of short curly brown hair that is a
little longer on top than on the sides. Her hair has gold highlights
wherever it catches the light. Beneath her narrow eyebrows are expressive
deep brown eyes that add a few years to an otherwise youthful face.
        She is dressed all in dark gray. On top, she wears a snugly
fitting tank top made of some light synthetic fabric.  Underneath the
shirt, her thin torso meets a flat, toned abdomen. Extending from round
shoulders are slender arms shaped by finely sculpted muscles. Her arms are
bare except for a computer strapped to her right wrist and a tattoo just
above the left. On the inside of her forearm, a few centimeters above the
wrist, a dainty Capula violet is drawn with delicate lines of a bold
indigo color. Below, stretch pants hug wiry athletic legs.

<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Below the sky, beginning to blush in the west because of the imminent
sunset, the short hair of Eva Sargent bobs up and down. Based on what she
is wearing, she appears to be jogging down the street.A short disatnce
behind her, two monolithic men also jog. Although clad in inconspicuous
workout gear, they wear identical sunglasses and maintain their delta
formation with the Representative. She has learned how to ignore them.</p>
<p>As if magically appearing from some unknown corner of the streets, Bazil
starts off on his own jog, his eyes catching sight of that very diplomat.
Trussed in an entirely black jumpsuit, which serves well enough for this
jog, the intelligence officer approaches her, whilest keeping a bit of a
distance for the very moment. He eyes the two men which do follow her,
studying each in turn.</p>
<p>The Representative's western course almost takes her to the passage into
Fountian Square, but this is where she decides to turn around. Reaching
the end of the avenue, she slows and springs up to a nearby tree. A few
quich quad stretches and she'll be on her way again. The thick trunk
dwarfs her slight frame. Her two followers also slow in their own time a
few moments later, and appear to window shop along the street.</p>
<p>As the pair of followers decide to 'window shop,' Bazil makes his move,
continuing his jog towards the tree. He makes every effort to come in from
and angle the woman doesn't have sight of, using the ambient evening noise
to mask his footsteps. He walks cautiously up to the tree, and offers up,
"Evening, Representative. 'Tis been quite a while." And that it has, too.  
The last time the woman might have seen him was the swoop races, but he
was undercover then. The last time she saw /Bazil/ was aboard the
Deliverance, when he was still but a pilot for Ghost Squadron. Now, in his
fully decked out Internal Intelligence garb, the man seems older, and more
formal than he ever did, wearing his civvies aboard the flagship
Deliverance.</p>
<p>Good grief. Sargent was kind of hoping for some piece and quiet tonight,
able to sneak time in her schedule for one of her much-missed jogs. Now,
with a snap, the demands of business seem to be pressing in again. With
all the poise of a dancer and all the dignity of a diplomat, in spite of
the growing patches of sweat on her brows and shirt, she gracefully lowers
her right leg from the stretch and pivots to face the voice. The fact that
he knows who she is does not surprise her. She is turning more heads
nowadays. Her calm is as much for his benefit as for the ones who watch
out of the corners of their eyes.  She has everything under control. A
quick scan of his apparel gives her some data to fill in the blanks from
the other times she's seen him. Her expression is neutral but not
unpleasant as she speaks. "Good evening, Chief McKenzie. I believe we have
not been formally introduced." She extends a well-disciplined hand. "Eva
Sargent."</p>
<p>In turn, Bazil extends his own hand, shaking her's briskly, "Bazil
McKenzie; I believe we've met before... either aboard the Deliverance, or
here." The intelligence officer himself gives hint to the faint glimmer of
sweat over his face, and the other patches of visible skin on his body, "I
do not wish to bother you. You may continue your jogging if you do not
mind a bit of company. I'm not here on any official business. Just a
couple of questions regarding a certain someone you may have information
on." He moves his arms to be firmly planted behind his back, crossed in
place. For anyone that knew him whilest he was in the diplomatic corps,
this is a strange sight indeed. Bazil, the one who always broke protocol,
and rarely kept himself in uniform. Had something changed?</p>
<p>In spite of her increased bloodflow from the jog, Sargent's hand is still
somewhat clammy. Cooler than one would expect. She smoothly returns her
hand to her side and begins to walk down the street again to the east. The
Representative should at lease make a start back to the Embassy, where a
shower and her office await. Immediately, she has a suspicion of who these
questions will be about, but the only thing that crosses her face is an
expression of calculation and regulation. There is no sense in jumping to
conclusions. Her voice is a mixture of pleasant lightness and official
efficiency. "It is no bother, Chief. I would be glad to be of assistance."</p>
<p>"I am well aware of your work with Ernie Pallando here on Caspar, Miss
Sargent, but I need to bring up... another matter."  Bazil starts off with
her pace, his eyes focused solely in front of him. Finally, he glances
over to the woman to his side, and begins, "John Donivan. I am sure you
know the name, and who he is?" If anything, the name hadn't been brought
up in a true conversation for months, and especially not by intelligence.
In fact, the man had never been inquired of at all by the mysterious black
agency.</p>
<p>The name had been brought up in diplomatic circles, in a fashion. Well
okay, not really. A mysterious communique and a conversation she would
much rather forget. But then there were the transcripts. "I have even met
him in person." Her eyes also stay forward, although they glance to the
ground in the closest thing she'll express as a sigh. "Unfortunately, I am
still waiting on word from Coruscant on whether the diplomatic office has
a response to his statements in the Senate meeting a month ago. I hope
they figure out what they're doing soon." The two hulks drift into
formation behind them.</p>
<p>Continuing at his pace, Bazil nods solemnly, "Aye. So, you know him then."
Glancing between the woman and the path before them, he inquires, "Tell
me, Eva, how much power do you think he holds over the New Republic, in
your own personal opinion?"  Now, why would someone come all the way out
to Caspar, to talk to a diplomat looking into Ernie Pallando's matters,
about John Donivan? Anyone's guess is good...</p>
<p>The informal use of her first name coming from such a formal apparition
beside her stands out. He really shouldn't think that our relationship is
that familiar if we have hardly ever spoken, Sargent thinks. She quickens
her pace, putting just a hint of the physical distance between them that
should exist professionally. "He is in a position of considerable
influence as head of the First Bank. And his personal contact with the
Griffons could potentially have repercussions on our foreign policy."</p>
<p>The distance, and formalism of the talk doesn't seem to bother Bazil, as
he continues on, "How possible do you think it is, that, say, he pays off
certain ranked members of the New Republic Military, Diplomatic Corps, and
even the Senate to provide him information, bend to his will, and what
not?" The last few parts are taken in a more dark and ominous tone. Sure,
the possibility is anyone's speculation, and it's no doubt that he
probably does such actions... but...</p>
<p>Sargent breaks into the jog now, which was another goal of speeding up
from the beginning. The transition could be smooth except for an obvious
measure of reluctance, as if her wiry legs really don't want to pound out
the distance to the Embassy.  But she wills them on anyway. In the back of
her mind, she wonders what kind of shape the Chief is in. She speaks
between deep breaths. "I wouldn't be surprised. Such things happened
before in the Old Republic." There is a bit of strain in her voice, hating
to think that the same ground would be walked again.</p>
<p>Bazil as well breaks into jog, keeping up the diplomat's pace, "What would
you say if I was certain that such things are true?" The man pauses for a
moment, keeping his gaze straight ahead, his arms dancing along with him,
before continuing, "With your experience in the diplomatic corps, do you
think that it would be possible to charge mister Donivan with any
particular charge for such action?" His voice hushes slightly, to a
mumble, "Forget the fact that he is the richest man in the universe, and
that he could order my death in an instant."</p>
<p>Here we go again. Sargent did not get into this job to play major roles in
criminal investigations. But with everything she's learned so far during
her stint here, she's learned that one still has an inevitable duty to
perform certain tasks.  Her forehead scowls gravely as the magnitude of
his statements becomes apparent. "Possibilitues I see include campaign
contribution violations, conspiracy, and tax crimes. I wonder when he was
last audited. But I can't say more until the facts are known. I'm no
lawyer."</p>
<p>"It's hard to tax the taxor. In any case, I appreciate your help, and
apologize deeply for bothering you. Farewell, Miss Sargent. I do hope your
work here goes well." And with that, Bazil darts behind the woman, and
into the shadows of a sidewalk, disappearing in mere moments, without
waiting for a response. Just like intel, to disappear like that. Is it
show, or custom?</p>
<p>Ah, Intel. Sargent wonders for a moment what it must be like to be unbound
in rules of propriety and discourse, diplomacy and decorum. But the very
decorum thaqt governs her everyday encounters holds firm even though the
encounter has ended. She shows no indication of possibly being affronted.
Perhaps she isn't at all. The Representative and her bodyguards glide of
back to the Embassy.</p>
