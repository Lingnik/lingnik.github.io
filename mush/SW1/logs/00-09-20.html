<h1>BazLogs: 00-09-20</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>Log Date: September 20, 2000</p>
<p>Players Involved: Kacela, Bazil</p>
<p>Synopsis: Bazil's mind is revelled upon Morganna in full unsurpressed glory, and even it ends up scaring /her/ into submission. And leaving her a bit more disturbed.</p>
<p>Background: Morganna ICly seduced Bazil in the White Night on Coruscant, while he was physically sick from something he picked up on Tatooine. And then, she decided to take him off to a hotel for a little... probing.</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Well, it had been a while. After having gone to the hotel, Bazil was made a frabjous shade of unconscious by Kacela. And now, he lays on the bed, his mind still a blurry blur of chaos. Insanity continues to breed throughout his mind, tapping at everything, and snaking around everything, pushing sanity into a deadlock grip that would eventually push him over the edge.</p>
<p>Kacela is very careful, she knows that she is in the viper's nest and so long as she is on Coruscant, she is at risk. As such, she draws on the darkness that quells in ehr soul and she places her hands on his temples. The insanity of his mind is delicious, and that is the first thing that hits her. Unfortunately, it's going to be a challenge to find out the useful things.. like.. where Bazil has been recently, if he has any plans for forthcoming missions. Thankfully for Bazil, morg isn't perfect at this.. but she will get at least a tidbit, so she hopes.</p>
<p>Immediately, the image of Selene sort of slices into full view, like a freight train hitting a gas tanker, both of them at full speed, with the train carrying explosive fertilizer. But nothing more comes to him at the thought of Selene, and it fades out of view as quickly as it appeared. Then, other thoughts seem to pop up in the chaos. Images of faces. People. Others in the New Republic, mostly. But others that were dressed in other garb. Caspians. Well-dressed businessmen. Especially John Donivan. His image seems to pop up everywhere, writhing with little mental snakes of evil all over it. But then, Ernie Pallando's face also carries the same marks. And others. Images of Skywalker, Solo, Calrissian. Nothing as far as missions, really. Just ignored paperwork. And then, one image flares up above all others, beaming like a beacon light over an ocean. The image of a frazzled woman, a little older than Baz, trussed in the uniform of a CDU Marine. Confusion accompanies her blurred face, the image of her mentally crossed out to try and push it back. His mind reaks of insanity. More than any other man would be capable under normal circumstances. But his circumstances were far from normal...</p>
<p>Sweat begins to bead on Kacela's brow and she takes a deep breath. Firgting through the weeds in Bazil's mind is hard work, and, after several minutes that feel like agonizing hours.. she finds something good. Although it's hard on her, Kacela tries to figure out who this woman is.. but the Insanity swirls away the image before she can get a handle on it. She makes a soft croaking sound as she pulls back, and she looks down at her shaking hands. Daggers threaten to split her skull in two, but she has one more face to blur.. she runs a hand through her hair, a CDU woman... interesting...</p>
<p>That very CDU woman. Ponderations of bewilderment surround her, as if everything relating to her were one big question mark, or a form left unfilled from the memory department. And then, the gaps slowly start to fill in, the insanity and chaos easily pushed back as the image reforms. Casey Johnson. A name. A fully completely image. Another one piques into view. A photo, of some sort. The two, on Caspar. A beach. They stand together, staring off into the orange sunset. A solitary beacon of light appears in the distance. A lighthouse. The light permeates everything, and eventually, the images are all replaced by intense white. A blank slate. Emptiness. Nothingness. Bazil's image appears in the center of the white, his body young, his face confused. He sits crosslegged in the middle of the room, sobbing softly. Other images come into view. Mangled bodies. His father, dead with a knife in his throat. Others. More vivid. Rotting corpses lining in a circle around him. Flight suits on some. Almost all Imperial. All dead. Rotting. Death. Fear. Loathing. Regret. Confusion. The insanity returns, brought on by another image. Altair Quila. Love and envy surrounds her. Confusion. ... Tatooine. Tatooine. The images reverse, all is swelled into a massive sandstorm of insanity, winds ripping the sands around his mind, ripping everything normal to shreds. And then it quells, leaving him in the middle of a moisture farm, with another woman. Her face is blurred. Her clothing dark. His mood official. He stares off into the distance with a pair of binoculars, examining a small farm off in the distance. Burnt. Burning. Dead. No bodies. Just dead. And then gone. The images gone. Just sand. Burning, scathing sand. Hot enough to ignight anything it touches. Hollow emotions, and the sands return, ripping at his mind again. No more pain. Just... insanity. Lack of sanity. Images of half-formed fantasies. Imperials. Lightsaber-wielding fellows. Ewok. Others. A child. An old man. A woman. Backgrounds of the ripping tides of sand that provoke utter insanity, one occasionally coming into pristine focus.</p>
<p>The images that Kacela gets as she pulls out of bazil's mind are enough to force the headache to be even browse, the thoughts of death.. fire.. agony are soothing to her, but the sheer barrage of them was something she was not expecting and is certainly not something she was mentally prepared for. With her hands shaking like a leaf, Kacela places her hands on Bazil's temples again, staying away from the painful barrage that threatens to destroy her mind and focusing on the evening. her brain hurts, but she does her best to fuzz out her identity for the evening.. she was just a friend.. who gave bazil Tea, and took him up to a room.. even though he may have thought there would be more.. but there was nothing more.. nothing more..</p>
<p>As the cooercions take their effects, the mental barrage of thoughts continue rabidly, and almost redoubled in effort, almost as if his mind was /trying/ to reveal something to her. The insanity rages on beneath like a fire in a forest. The streaking flames hitting all the brush, but leaving the tips of the trees unbothered. And then, the wildfire burns up a solitary tree. One of his true self. It is struck down, leaving the veritable forest of others in it's place, even the ashes of his solitary personality burning with a raging heat, ripping even the atoms to shreds. And more faces. John Donivan, Ernie Pallando, and Hul Pantek. Together. Like a mugshot. Each with a solitary hand in the other's pocket, and the other hand holding a blaster to the other's head. Each smiling contently with pockets bulging of money. Wealth. Corruption. And then that vanishes too under the fire, to be replaced with more. Harsh thoughts. Much harsher. Like videos, images from a first-person perspective. On an asteroid. A knife in hand... a sleeping man's head before him... then... the knife is in the neck. Blood streams across the sheets, and then the image is gone. More images. Death. Horror. And then, blankness. The forest is gone. Everything is gone. The white. Back. A small child, dirty and grubby, in the center of the room. Playing with some rocks and bones before him. The face is tilted down, unseen. Images around him. Faces look down on him. Donivan, again. Pallando. Arands. Altair. Others. Figures of importance. Looking down on him. As he plays with the figures of death and destruction. As they are tossed casually before him like toys in a toybox. And then, he stops, the face rising playfully, a grin over his face. Bazil. A scar. Diagonal. Across his face. From the forehead to chin, across the nose. It sits deep, curling at the ends into pink fury. The ends become redder, the center pink. Then, the image grows hotter, the images around him grinning with cynical glee. The scar grows hotter, redder. Burning. Fire. And then, at the epitomy of heat, the image explodes viscerally, red stoked embers flying across in every direction, scortching everything in it's path. More death. The images collapse, one by one, dying simply in their places. Until all that is left... are the bones and rocks... against the firey sands of his insanity, nothing more construing itself to the surface, everything else buried under the pure and overwhelmingly powerful insanity.</p>
<p>Never before has Kacela seen so much insanity, had so many barrages from so many different directions! it's overwhelming and as soon as she manages to fuzz herself out of there, she pulls out, but finds herself being sucked in again! Bazil may not have the strongest will in the world, but the insanity is ferocious and almost far, far too much for Kacela to handle. Finally she manages to get her way out of there, but the exit isn't completely clean.. an oozing pall mingles with the insanity, focused around this evening.. Kacela shakingly rises to her feet and she almost falls over. it';s been a long time since something like this has overwhelmed her, and she;s out of practice. At least she'll be able to do something.. but.. how much of this is fact.. and how much of it is just insanity induced fantasy? Only someone as powerful as her master could know. With that, Kacela backs towards the door and leaves Bazil safe and sound and unharmed in bed. "Sweet Dreams.." She whispers with a croak... and she tries to drive some of the images out of her mind.. tantalizing, yes.. but even disturbing to her.</p>
<p>Almost as an unconscious expression of farewell, the corners of Bazil's maw writh up into a cynical grin, his mind projecting the thoughts even now, as she leaves his mind. As she is out of his mind. As if his insanity somehow manages to escape his head, scathing the scene around him. Ripping reality to shreds, and replacing it with something so horrifically gruesome, he just has to grin over it all. And as quickly as the grin came, it vanishes again, and searing looks of pain flood his mind and face, the thoughts turning to things that even he can't control... things that affected him so wholly, that they disturbed even him, in this altered state. Things that were far too lost in the chaos to be dug out without much more skill, and ability to withstand the ferocity of his mental attacks. And then, once again, the image inside his own mind fades to white... as if a loop. The child, playing solemnly, now singing a small tune, garnered from some Tatooine village. The kind of thing sang in bars. Or during times of despair. Of death. And how it would all slowly come to an end. The utterations escape his lips slightly, a tone carrying wistfully throughout the room in demonic tones, "Farewell, my little demon... farewell, to all your control... soon... it will all end... soon... we'll all be dead." Almost too low to be audible, the whispered sounds mock Kacela, thought he is unaware of it. Soon, it would all come to a breaking point. Lives would be lost. Deaths would outnumber births. And one victor alone would stand in the middle, surveying a battlefield of corpses. And Bazil... he'd see it all to it's bitter end. All the while orchestrating the entire escapade from his twisted little writhing mind.</p>
