<p>Synopsis: </p>
<p>Background: </p>
<p>Loy_Marin's Description:
        Before you is a man of striking qualities. There is nothing plain
or ordinary about the fellow, from his perfectly coiffed brown hair to his
broad shouldered build. His skin is a well tanned caucasian, and his waist
is slim, though it is uncertain whether this is due to a regiment of diet
and proper exercise, or simply the work of skilled surgeons paid gross
amounts of money to make the man look good. His face is made up of smooth
angles and unblemished skin, befitting a man giving world-shattering news
or trying to sell a used airspeeder. In short, he expels arrogant
confidence and unheralded reliability with a glance, oozing good will and
competency as a Rancor might dribble drool out the side of its horribly
misshapen mouth.
        Loy's clothing fits the man in ways beyond the usual definition of
the word. A blue suit accentuates his sculpted features, the Corellian cut
tailored to fit his form perfectly. The suit is made up of a cerulean
blazer with matching pants, complimented by a fashionable tie and simple,
black loafers. Though the outfit itself is nothing particularly fancy, it
reaks of good taste and high expense in the way a racy new sports speeder
impresses danger and excitement.</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Fountain Square - Plaxton City</p>
<p>The huge buildings in the background threaten to take over this
small patch of green that is the center of Plaxton City. A stone fountain
-still in place from another time- sits in the center of the square. It
depicts a young woman looking into the sky. Water flares around her and
bursts into a star pattern ten feet above her head. The inscription at the
base of the fountain is written in the aging language of a more romantic
time. 'Farewell, for all journeyers that leave this place shall always
return to call it home.'
        Newly planted, lush trees now dominate the square, shading the
area from the night sky above is clear. Dark bushy leaves cover the
branches, offering shade for the ground below. Patches of well maintained
grass surround the base of the trees, allowing space for visitors to relax
or picnic. The central, most famous area of Plaxton City, seems to become
more and more park-like with the frequent additions and maintnence. A pair
of Marines quietly watch over the area.</p>

<p>Once more, the reporter Loy Marin enters Fountain Square only this time,
his stride seems to have some purpose. He moves toward a set of benches
facing the fountain and statue display, pausing there as he studies the
reasonably quiet city center. Making some internal decision, he nods, then
reaches into an inside blazer pocket to draw out a small communication
device. "C1," he says, flicking the thumbswitch to on. "Meet me in the
square. I've decided to go ahead and rap this story up." He switches the
comm unit off and puts it back in the pocket he'd drawn it from.</p>
<p>Quite solemnly, as usual, the worn face of Mege Vauki's graces the square.
Slowly, he trods in from the south, his hands gently resting inside his
wrinkled trouser pockets. With an absent-minded determination, he wanders
aimlessly through the mediocre crowds of the square, not paying much
attention to where he goes, how he goes, or why. His face is that of lack
of concern, lit softly from the street and city lights, creating a gentle
glow about his face. The face is that of almost joy, right now, too; his
thoughts residing on happier times in this very square. It had been a
/very/ long time since he was happy here... maybe it was for the best that
he hadn't come back to visit for so long.</p>
<p>As the newsman waits for his camera droid, he too looks about the square
again. What he's looking for is unclear, but as his gray eyed glaze flits
across the face of Mege Vauki once more, a memory begins to tickle the
back of his mind. He chases the memory a moment, trying to determine where
he's seen this complacent, perhaps melancholy face before. His curiosity
gets the best of him, and he moves from his place near the fountain to try
and intercept the fellow's path. "Excuse me," he calls as he approaches.</p>
<p>For an inconceivable moment, Mege doesn't respond... he continues on his
merry little way, benign to what goes on around him. Finally, he realizes
the words were, in fact, meant for him, and he pauses in his steps. The
voice, familiar to the man in some respects, causes him to turn out of
pure curiosity. As recognition sets in, Mege blinks rapidly... the
all-too-famous Loy Marin. Well, isn't this quite the surprise; after
spotting him in that fight the other day in full sunlight, he wasn't
expecting to see him here, in the early darkness of night. The confusion
wilts from his face rapidly, and he smiles, responding lightly, "Can I
help you?" His words are elequantly formed, despite his appearance for the
moment.  Not a wink of tiredness wafts over his rough face at the moment,
either. The lights from the fountain nearby casting eerie moving shadows
of light over his face, lighting it just enough to be recognized by nearly
anyone in the square.</p>
<p>>> Loy_Marin looks at you.</p>
<p>For a moment, Loy begins to falter as the target of his curiosity turns
and the play of lights and shadows gives the fellow an eerie cast. The
moment passes quickly, though, and Loy smoothes his features to those of
the performing IGNews anchorman.  He says in a rich baritone, "I hope that
you can. I'm Loy Marin, of IGNews, and I was wondering if I might be able
to ask you a few questions regarding Caspar and its current political
situation?" And, of course, the fellow's name, but why be obvious about
such things?</p>
<p>The response is enthroned in pure confusion... Caspar? Political
situation? Sure, Mege had heard about them a little, but was unconcerned
over them for the most part. But, he'll try, with what little he knows. He
doesn't want to be rude, of course, "Sure... I'm not sure how much I can
help you. I haven't been keeping a close eye on the stuff soo much
recently."  With everything that has been going on recently, it might not
be /that/ hard to miss what's happening here. Especially to a foreigner
like himself. Enthralled in his grubby civilian clothes, Mege looks quite
the opposite of the well-dressed mannerisms of the reporter. Like the
opposite ends of the galaxy, the two seem quite in contrast. Even the
complexions&#8212;Mege's worn and weathered, with Loy's fair and well cared
for&#8212;keep the two in seperate corners. "Vauki," the man starts, "Mege
Vauki... will this be on camera?" The unquestioned answer, and question,
are striking; his voice is nearly perfect, his words carefully articulated
into what might be only heard from the very mouths of high-weighted
diplomats, bureaucrats, or politicians.</p>
<p>As if in answer to Vauiki's question concerning the filming of this
interview, a camera droid floats into the Fountain Square looking very
much like an over-ripened targetting remote. It hovers and bobs and skims
around people until it's just behind Loy Marin. It's an answer, but
apparently an incorrect one as Loy responds, "It won't be necessary to
record this."  He pauses a moment as he thinks about the Vauki has given.
He then continues, "It's just a matter of perspective that I'm looking
for, actually, whether you are a local citizen or just an infrequent
visitor. Now that I mention that, though, where is it that you call home?"</p>
<p>The camera evokes a bit of a paranoid response, but only for a moment.
He's never liked cameras, but then again, Mege isn't quite fond of people
either. Slowly, he nods in response, moving his eyes from the camera to
Loy, "I'm just a visitor... I stop in quite often to trade, and whatnot. I
keep and ear out to what goes on, just so I know when not to come in...
but, as for home... well... my ship, mostly. But, if yer lookin' for where
I was born, that'd be Tatooine..." The once-elequant speech slowly blurs
into a melancholy of slurred native speech. Hiding an accent for too long
grows tiring... and almost boring. The voice, now, though, is definately
based off some remote area. His eyes flicker to the camera, nervously, and
then back to the reporter. He doesn't like it... not one bit.</p>
<p>From between the buildings runs in a small young woman. She is known to
some as Eva Sargent. From what she is wearing, and the patch of sweat that
grows on the front of her tank top, she must be out for an evening jog.
Enjoying the break from the gloomy weather of the recent past. She sees
some groups milling around the voting booth, discussing the elections and
the candidates, and decides to steer clear of the crowd. Her breaths are
heavy, and her damp brow is furrowed in concentration.</p>
<p>Being the perceptive journalist that he is, Loy notices the Mege's
displeasure at the presence of the camera droid. Though this strange man
has now supplied his name and where he's from, Loy still can not put his
finger on why this veritable opposite to himself is familiar. His
curiosity begins to wane, but after plunging this far into the idea of a
brief interview, it's too late to turn back. To aid in this effort, he
turns to the floating camera droid and says, "C1, why don't you hover over
near the news terminals and see if you can get some good background
footage? I'll only be a few more moments." As the small cambot complies,
Loy turns back to Mege, saying, "It sounds like you've seen quite a bit in
your travels. What, in your experience, is Caspar's greatest strength in
regards to its independent government?"</p>
<p>Jairen enters the square from the north.
Jairen has arrived.
Jairen comes striding down the way, cloak blowing in the breeze as he
moves towards the sandbar.</p>
<p>>> Sargent looks at you.</p>
<p>At a reasonably close distance to the fountain and statue display stands
Loy Marin and Mege Vauki. They appear to be having a quiet discussion or
perhaps interview. A hovering camera droid floats near the news terminals,
panning back and forth, gathering footage.</p>
<p>>> Jairen looks at you.
Jairen passes the fountain and enters into the Bar without much ado.
Jairen enters the Sandbar.
Jairen has left.</p>
<p>Mege's attitude improves greatly as the little droid floats off into the
distance. His attention once again returns onto the reporter, as he
studies every movement of muscle on the man's face. As the question
concludes, the scrougy man pauses in consternation, his thoughts dwelling
over the question for an innumerable number of seconds. Finally, after
much deliberation, the man, now seemingly unaware of anything else that
goes on around him in the square, replies, "I'd have to say it's that it's
pretty much self-sufficient... it can handle most anything sent it's way
with reasonable efficiency.  She'cn also keep out of the other faction's
business as much, or as little, as she wants ta'." The light trickling
over Mege's face is enough to cause that eerie look to continue, leaving a
strange glow around him. The water trickling in the background offers a
nice subtone to the talking and other various noises in the subdued
atmosphere of the square's evening appearance.</p>
<p>The soft grassy turf in the square squishes softly under Sargent's feet as
she veers to the north. In spite of the slight slope in the terrain, and
the occasional rodelt rut, her strides are even and confident. She draws
nearer the fountain, giving the reporter and his companion a wide berth.
Her pace slows. Upon reaching the fountain, she plants one hand on the
edge and dips the other hand into the cool water, splashing some on her
face. Her cheeks carry a pink glow from the exertion.</p>
<p>Ernie enters the square from the south.
Ernie has arrived.</p>
<p>Pallando steps out of a hovercab near the IGN terminals. He bends to the
monitor to catch the days headlines and see whats afoot in the wide
universe this evening.</p>
<p>Loy nods slowly as the other man speaks, looking the part perfectly for an
aggresively attentive listener. Of course, the words themselves are the
very definition of what Caspar has made it's cornerstone. If it weren't
for the system's flaunting of its independence, half the businesses that
draw in so much money would probably be elsewhere. Loy says at last,
nodding once more, "That's all the questions I have for you at this time.
Thank you very much for that time, Mister Vauki. You've been a great help
to me."</p>
<p>Pallando shakes his head, "Batraad too? So no one is running for that
slot?" He shakes his head and wanders off.</p>
<p>If not the strangest, that was at least the second-strangest&#8212;and
shortest&#8212;conversation Mege has ever participated in.  Well, that's quite
alright. The fewer words of Vauki's out in the universe the better...
"You're very welcome Mr. Marin. I hope I've been of some sort of use to
you. I've always been a big fan of your articles... been reading them for
years." The words are slightly more articulated again, formed better than
they were only moments before. As the shadow of the woman passes into his
view, Mege turns his head briefly. The shadow manages to mask his body
slightly, concealing it into the shadows yet again... if there is any
recognition in his face of who the woman is, he doesn't let it out. But
instead, he turns his head back to the reporter, and smiles softly.</p>
<p>Ernie walks down East Blake St.
Ernie has left.</p>
<p>A shiver runs down Loy's back as Mege turns away. As far as interviews go,
it was incredibly short, but then, it wasn't actually formed to gather any
more information than what was necessary to satisfy Loy's curiosity.
Which, unfortunately, it wasn't. He takes a step back from the man, then
looks about the square again. He, too, casts a glance at the woman that
decided to take advantage of the fountain's cool waters. With her, though,
full recognition enters Loy's eyes. A smile spreads across his lips, and
he begins moving in her direction.</p>
<p>The crowds around the voting booth and the news terminal are still quite
thick, so Sargent will need to check the news later. Her brief break by
the fountain to refresh concluded, Sargent pushes herself up from the
edge. Her face now drips from sweat and water from the fountain. She
resumes her jog. The path she takes continues from the fountain eastward.</p>
<p>With deliberate measures, the civilian-clad man called Mege slips away
from the fountain, and into the darker areas of the streets. Hidden for
the most part now, he trods his way around, stretching his limbs as he
goes. Why is he awake at these hours? That's anyone's guess... even Vauki
doesn't know why he's up right now. But, he's determined to make the best
of it.  With his companions all asleep back aboard his ship, he takes the
time to look around, keeping himself in the more shadowed areas of the
square, peering around. He sighs, stopping slightly, at the edge of some
light source of a nearby streetlamp.  Peering up, he stares off into the
night skies, the starts twinkling softly there... "She's up there... I
just know it,"  comes his whispered voice, twinkling out of existance just
like some supernovaed star. A look of soft sadness rests over his face, as
he relinquishes a solitary hand up to his neck, to gently stroke at the
gold medallion hanging there.</p>
<p>"I've changed my mind again, C1," Loy says, addressing the mechanically
patient camera droid. At its master's voice, the droid stops panning about
gathering background footage. The reporter continues speaking to it,
saying, "I'll go ahead and hold off on the conclusion to the senate story
another day. It may, after all, still end differently." As he stops
speaking, his gray eyes roam the square once more, and a thoughtful
expression covers his face.</p>
<p>Sargent's strides pick up pace again as she heads out of the square. In
spite of how short her legs are, she is able to cover a lot of territory
in a remarkably short time. Her face becomes set with concentration as she
takes each step.  Counting heartbeats and breaths.</p>
<p>Sargent walks down West Blake St.
Sargent has left.</p>
<p>Slowly, the form of Mege Vauki starts off south, his wistful eyes dropping
down to the ground... his hands are removed from the delicate chain of
gold around his neck, and carefully dragged down into the dark depths of
his trouser pockets. His eyes glance around once more, before he shakes
his head softly. In almost a single instant, he grows tired, his eyelidss
drooping ever-so-softly. Maybe he'll get some work done tomorrow... keep
himself occupied... so that he can't think about the other current
events...</p>
<p>Loy's thoughtful pause... or his daydreaming... it's sometimes difficult
to tell the two apart... finally comes to an end as he makes some sort of
internal decision. He gestures to the cambot to follow, then begins
walking to the East with a stern expression on his face.</p>
<p>With his floating cambot in tow, Loy heads East down Blake Street.</p>
<p>Without a single look back, Mege continues on his way, delved deep in
thoughts of sadness to the past... he has had a hard life, that's for
sure. And it all leads on up to this, however it might end... but who
knows. Maybe he'll find his place finally... it's would definately be a
blessing if he could finally be happy with himself... even without Casey.
Again, the hand is withdrawn to his neck to brush the chain, before placed
back into the pocket. Sleep. He must get some sleep before tomorrow. Vauki
thusly disappears into the cool Casperian night...</p>
<p>Loy_Marin walks down East Blake St.
Loy_Marin has left.</p>
