<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Operations -- NRSC Deliverance</p>
<p>This room is similiarly composed of the gleaming white walls
common throughout this vessel. However, its appearance differs from most
of the others in two major respects. First, the room is rounded, and
slopes down, providing ampitheater-like seating across three quarters of
the arc. The second is the massive holoprojector unit at the base of the
room, capable of rendering crucial details in a three dimensional area
above it. Towards the aft of the room, near the exit archway, the library
computer controls the holoprojector, as well as the trio of transparent
data windows arrayed around the top of the room. The final quarter of the
room is available for personnel to run briefings or hold additional
equipment as needed.</p>

 &lt;P>ort leads to Command Corridor -- NRSC Deliverance.</p>
<p>As he enters Operations, Loraiil notices various familiar faces. Lando,
who took him on a trip to 'Scant, Captain Darklighter of course. A slight
cringe. Captain Diggs, whom he has noticed at the meeting with the
Casparian President and Eva Sargent. He salutes all and retires to a
corner to follow the proceedings.</p>
<p>Skeezix steps into the room, closely followed by an astromech droid. He
looks about the room quietly, an almost detached expression coming across
his features. The droid is quite silent.</p>
<p>The boring intel agent is already in the room, down on the floor, standing
near the edge. In his hand is a datapad, which he reads over slowly. His
face is dull, and almost bored.</p>
<p>Standing just a bit offset of the exit of the turbolift is the Ensign,
Wes's silverish eyes survey the deck, 
noting the presence of many higher ups, including the 'Admiralty' as he
notices Howie stepping on deck, he straightens out 
and shouts aloud, "Captain on deck!"</p>
<p>Howie Darklighter, Captain of this vessel, the Deliverance, is currently
standing in the center of the ampitheather-like Operations room. He is
quietly speaking with Captain Diggs, filling him quickly about what he's
going to say in the meeting before shuffling some files around. The
exhaustion is more clear in the Captain's expression this time as he
watches as people begin to file in, the murmuring of various people
resounding in the room, as a mass as the conversations are all mixed
together.</p>
<p>Strain from dealing with events of the past week is beginning to wear on
Sargent. Though her reserved, neutral expression does not show fatigue,
there are signs of compounded lack of sleep. Skin that looks the tiniest
bit pallid. Lips chapping. Limp hair. However, her eyes are ever alert and
thinking. The willpower she musters is still in full strength, holding the
posture of her petite body firm. She sits halfway down the amptheater, not
too far away from the briefing stage.</p>
<p>The Intel agent actually shakes his head, whispering something under his
breath to the captain... a definate frown is there, overpowering every
other emotion visible on his face. His uniform his a mess, obviously
thrown on at the last second.</p>
<p>Arands steps into the Operations room, still in his flight suit. His short
hair is loosely plastered to his scalp before he runs a finger through it
to give it a fuller appearance. Arands walks in on the heels of Skeezix.
The StarOps General flashes a faint smile to his GroundOps counterpart as
they step down into the briefing area. Find a place to lean, Arands
crosses his arms and gives the room and its occupants a quick scan.</p>
<p>seeing all the people in a disheveled state of being, Loraiil wonders what
could have happened. They had found the Death Star, perhaps? He could only
guess, so Loraiil continues to stand against one wall, drinking in the
details.</p>
<p>One of the perks of arriving before anyone else is actually having a place
to sit. Near the back of the room, facing the door, sits former General
Lando Calrissian. Amongst his many other 'talents' Calrissian has a knack
of being able to exude confidence even without saying a word. Though in
private he may admit some doubts, in public&#8212;and especially not in front
of the enlisted men&#8212;he never will. "The Empire hasn't built a machine
that I can't destroy." he boasts to someone nearby.</p>
<p>When Luke Skywalker arrives, he descends the steps towards the staging
area and takes a seat on the same row as Sargent. The strain and tension
in the room have played a part in dampening down idle conversation, but
the Jedi nonetheless glances over at the young diplomat and smiles
slightly in greeting. When he glances around the amphitheatre, looking for
familiar faces, he notes Lando and his confident assertions of victory,
and smiles wryly to himself.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Operations chamber is just about full and the people who
were filing in begins to lessen, the Captain clears his throat which is
slightly amplified from his position, before speaking loudly, addressing
everyone, "Good evening everyone. I know that this may not be the best of
times but I called this emergency session for a reason. Apparently we have
just found out where the Death Star is going to strike next." The Captain
speaks and then stops, giving everyone a few seconds to let this new
tidbit of information to sink in.</p>
<p>Diggs is not surprised at the comment&#8212;his face, completely dull, as
always, peers around the room, slowly studying each face in turn as it
reacts. He slips the datapad back into some hidden pocket in his uniform,
and proceeds to cross his arm.</p>
<p>Expecting a briefing on the unwillingness of the CDU to assist the New
Republic in its ongoing fight against the EMpire, Arands was clearly
unprepared for an announcment of this magnatude. He raises an eyebrow -
the only outward sign of his surprise - but says nothing. Anyone who knows
the man would realize he is already running through possible mission
profiles to put his pilots through to get ready for such a mission.</p>
<p>Dauthus enters from the open archway.
Dauthus has arrived.</p>
<p>Altair enters from the open archway.
Altair has arrived.</p>
<p>Loraiil almost reels with shock. They knew already! The one moment he
feels fear, the next he is his ambitious self. That meant the Fleet would
move soon, and he would be a part of it all, one of the first to
volunteer...While dreaming of his future, Loraiil barely acknowledges the
Sullustan in an Admiral's uniform that appears in the doorway next to him.
Then, fully conscius, he shout-whispers: "Admiral Dauthus!", and salutes
immediatley.</p>
<p>The events that have thrust Sargent's diplomatic position so far into the
forefront still leave her somewhat surprised, but she doesn't have time to
think about how she got here or where she's going. She glances around the
room with a gaze clear as water. As it falls on General Calrissian, she
gives no reaction to indicate feelings about the first time they met.
Then, as Skywalker comes to sit down a few seats away, takes a deep
breath. Years of experience take over, and she returns his smile. But her
attention is immediately redirected to Captain Darklighter. This is big.</p>
<p>The Admiral steps in, late following a private holomeeting with his
now-coworkers at High Command, and remains toward the back of the room,
nodding to the young officer who greets him at the door.</p>
<p>Luke simply listens with his brows arched, relieved and worried at the
same time as he folds his arms and narrows his eyes, forgetting the other
attendees as he focuses on the captain's speech.</p>
<p>Late as always, Colonel Quila comes scuttling into the meeting. Looking
rather sheepish and trying to avoid the gazes turned on her as she comes
in, she grabs the closest seat she can see, which involves climbing over a
few higher ups, accompanied by many excuse me's and pardon me's and much
shuffling of feet.</p>
<p>Though a *buzz* does permeate the room upon Captain Darklighter's
announcement, Lando is not a part of it. He leans back into his chair,
allowing the chatter to die down, and waiting for the Captain to continue.</p>
<p>Kelvis enters from the open archway.
Kelvis has arrived.</p>
<p>Yes, the Captain does let a few seconds blow by before continuing on with
what he is about to say.  "Apparently, we have just recently gotten news
of the Death Star's next target and the answer is a surpise to my as well.  
Instead of a military installation as most military strategists would
surmise, apparently the next target is Ithor, the beautiful planet of
life. Now I know this may be a shock to many of you, if not all, but we
must keep our wits together. We have to create plans to atleast find a way
to delay the Death Star. I know we cannot go up against the monstrosity
just yet, we do not have the right information. But the information will
be coming soon, hopefully soon as our Intelligence people are doing their
very best to gather the data for us." With the last part said, the Captain
gives Diggs, the Intel Liason who is standing next to him a brief nod.</p>
<p>Kelvis wanders in, looking much cleaner then the night before. However, he
was involved in some sort of repairs, hence his lateness in getting here.
He glances around, and leans against the wall, trying not to be too big of
an intrusion.</p>
<p>A very disturbed and deep smile crosses Luke's face as he listens to this
information, a million possible strategies rising up in his mind, as well
as a million questions. Reminding himself to be patient, he swallows and
fixes his gaze on the Captain and the Intel officer, ready to hear the
rest of the report before making any suggestions of his own.</p>
<p>"Very soon, if my people are on the right track," the intel officer simply
offers to the gathered crowd. He observes the goings on as a whole...
taking in Howie's words without actually looking at him. Instead, he seems
quite more interested in how everyone deals with this latest news.</p>
<p>Any target is bad news. Sargent's steadfast posture breaks and she slowly
slumps over, her eyes blank. A sigh rasps out. Etiquette rules are tossed
out the airlock, and her bony elbows come to rest on her knees, her narrow
shoulders collapsing further. She cradles her face in her hands. The word
lingers. No... But no. As the Captain says, there is little energy to be
wasted on emotions. She inhales sharply and draws herself up from the
slouch. Her now empty hands ball into two tiny fists that hover just in
front of her chin. Her voice is low, almost to herself. Her gaze dead
serious. "It could be a ploy."</p>
<p>You see," Lando comments to someone nearby (again) "it's just as I
thought. Valak is as arrogant as the day is long. He wants to show the
galaxy, but more importantly himself, that he can take the New Republic's
best shot and come out unscathed." He crosses both arms about his chest
and listens to Captain Diggs with a rather peeved expression&#8212;which echoes
the sentiments of many within the New Republic (namely how could the
Empire have built a planet right under our noses?)</p>
<p>Dauthus leans against the back wall by the door, shaking his head and
folding his arms as he listens. He'd already heard the news himself, of
course, but it sounded that much worse when received by an unsuspecting
crowd. At least this time he didn't have to be the messenger...</p>
<p>Arands is watching Howie for several moments after he speaks. He ignores
the nod to the Intel Captain. He seems focused on something else - a point
well beyond where the Captain of the Deliverance is standing. Sargent's
quiet voice brings Arands out of his thoughts with a shaking of his head.
"No. Valak wants us to know where he is going to strike next. If we send a
fleet against him, he destroys our biggest ships and loses some fighters.
If we send nothing, we appear to be as uncaring about the Ithorians as the
Empire is." Arands turns his gaze now to Diggs and raises an eyebrow. "The
Death Star appeared at Gastus with protection. The Death Star over Endor
had a shield generator. The first one at Yavin had no shields at all. What
we need to know is: Is this third one shielded even when on the attack?"</p>
<p>"We honestly don't know. That's one of the things we hope to find out
within the next day or two. If it is, however, we'll have to find some
other way to destroy the thing, compared to the past two times." Diggs'
voice is calm, and explanatory. He surely expects some anger and
resentment at himself for Intel's blunders. But, it's not their fault
entirely. Sighing softly, he just stops there, and continues observing.</p>
<p>Avitar enters from the open archway.
Avitar has arrived.</p>
<p>Avitar slowly walks in and sees Loraiil. "Fancy seeing you here."</p>
<p>Loraiil had been watching with more and more interest, until his friend
Avitar shows up in the doorway. He pulls him aside and explains the
situation, accompanied by the widening of Avitars eyes.</p>
<p>"Ideas are more than welcomed in this meeting, that is what this meeting
is for. You all are now informed of what is to happen, now we must act
together and create a plan to try and stop or atleast hinder this
monstrosity without compromising too much of our Fleet." The Captain
continues as the talking stops briefly before nodding to Sargent, "Yes, it
could be a ploy to draw out our Fleet. Like I said, Ithor isn't a
strategic military target... there are many other places that could hurt
the New Republic even more. What we have to decide now is what to do... I
have a few plans in my mind as well and anymore is more than welcomed."</p>
<p>Avitar scratches his head in deep thought.</p>
<p>A few moments pass after Darklighter's last words, and then the Jedi
Master speaks up, "Shouldn't we do something about evacuating the
Ithorians?" Luke asks in a loud but calm voice into the quiet. "No matter
if it is a ploy or not. It's not worth risking an entire race."</p>
<p>Altair continues to look inconspicuous and low key as the meeting
progresses as she tries desperately to catch up. As she becomes oriented
to what is going on, she presses her lips together and rubs her chin. It
would be so much more effective to rub her chin if she had a beard or
something. But that would be gross.</p>
<p>The Intel agent calmly replies to Skywalker slowly, "It would be a nice
gesture... but, if the Imperials catch wind of it, they might decide to
switch targets. Leaving us back where we began." He sighs, closing his
eyes to the room for a moment, and then returns to his boring stature,
opening his eyes once again.</p>
<p>Kelvis looks at all, and tries not to speak. He's no great military
strategist. He's a Techincian. A glowbeam goes out, you call him, a
holoterminal dies, he's your man, but when it comes to devising plans for
affecting an attack on the Death Star, he's as helpful as a newborn bantha
cub.</p>
<p>Arands nods in agreement with Luke's suggestion. "That should be our
highest priority, just in case. Ithor may not be a strategic military
target, but the destruction of a non-human world will serve the Empire far
more than destroying a military installation or a few ships will. It'll
surely create suspicion about the New Republic's loyalty to non-human
beings."</p>
<p>The varied responses to her admittedly paranoid statement make Sargent sit
up even straighter. She glances to the Intel officer, and gives him a half
nod in agreement. It is dangerous to operate without knowing all the
facts. But it is equally dangerous to do nothing at all. As the
conversation switches to what todo with Ithor, the weight of the decision
they may need to make here tonight weighs heavily on her eyes.</p>
<p>"I agree with General Arands." the retired General says speaking up. "This
is no ploy. Valak wants us to know where he's attacking next. He wants to
have every advantage and yet still force us to sit by and watch as he
destroys yet another planet. Until we receive adequate intelligence," he
adds peering at the Intel officer, "that's all we'll be able to do, sit
back and watch. Hell I'm not even sure Valak would engage our fleet even
if we did send it, he might just withdraw and leave us with the knowledge
that we sent everything we could after him and still couldn't stop him
from destroying Ithor. I agree with Luke, we have to put everything into
evacuating the planet before the Empire strikes. We can't go up against
that monster yet, we don't have the information necessary."</p>
<p>The Admiral, upon hearing Luke's comment, speaks up, projecting his voice
loudly across the room -- or as loudly as his voice allows, at least.
"I'll field that one...my contacts on Coruscant have sent several large
transports to Ithor quietly, and from there, the transports will be in the
hands of the local government. No public statement has been issued to the
inhabitants of Ithor at large, and the government there has been
instructed not to do so until further notice." Dauthus says this
matter-of-factly, though much of it did anger him a bit when he'd first
discussed the situation with High Command.</p>
<p>Avitar soley agrees with Arands. "If we show compassion toward non-human
systems then we are in a position to defend all non-human systems which is
seemingly difficult." In that light Avitar is rubbing his chin thinking
"Then what systems do we save and which systems don't we save." Avitar
steps back and rests his head on his hand.</p>
<p>From back the room, Loraiil speaks up, slightly nervous, he has known this
situation too well. Say something and all you get was annoyed looks. But
Sithspit, it was his duty to suggest something if he thought of it. Even
if it was hardly realizable. "uh, Sirs? May I voice a suggestion?"</p>
<p>"Master Skywalker..." Diggs utters slowly, wandering over towards the Jedi
to make sure he hears his idea, "During the rebellion, you and Mr. Solo
were towed /inside/ a Death Star when you wandered to close. I'm
wondering, perhaps, it that might not be a bad idea this time? Somehow,
get a ship inside, and blow the blasted creation from the inside?" While
his suggestion *is* a bit crazy, it's a suggestion nonetheless.</p>
<p>Kelvis looks up from the ground, and says simply, hearing Diggs' radical
announcement. "Whoever does that is as good as gone themselves." His voice
is semi ominious, and he then lapse into silence, and resumes looking at
the floor.</p>
<p>Good. The thought of not warning the Ithorians is being left farther and
farther behind. Ahd the Admiral's report of readiness for an evacuation is
encouraging. Sargent still sits quietly, of little help in discussions of
military tactics like this. Her hands are folded and poised on her lap.</p>
<p>The Captain listens to everyone and nods in general towards the idea of
evacuating Ithor. "Ithor must be evactuated... we can't take the chance on
whether or not the Imperials catch wind of this. If they do and they
divert their plans, then we have saved a planet. That is our objective, to
save as much of Ithor as possible. What I suggest is bait the Death Star.
If Valak's intention is to destroy the Fleet, maybe we can slowly lure the
Death Star away to allow more time for the massive exodus out of the
planet. If not, then we can only pray that we have gotten enough people
out in time. I have another plan that could be set in motion. But it would
require extra tools. To impliment this, we'll need some mining equipment,
drills perhaps that remote controlled and can drill rather big holes. If
we acquire the proper supplies, we may be able to create makeshift
torpedoes that dig into the Death Star instead of blowing up against the
surface which would be utterly useless."</p>
<p>Luke finds himself rubbing his chin as he glances up at Captain Diggs.
"The only reason the Death Star didn't shoot us out of the sky was because
they wanted to find out if the Death Star plans were on board the Falcon.
However... the idea of a covert movement inside the Death Star itself
might be more plausible. If it's shielded, they could be lowered from
inside. Sabotage," he says more clearly, glancing all around as he's sure
the danger of such a mission would be obvious to all but the most naive or
ignorant.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Intel agent close yet again for a moment, as he ponders,
"I have men that would do it. Even if it meant dying." His eyes open
again, a bit of tired sadness running through his face. "If it had to be
done, I'd lead the force-damned mission myself. Of course, though, the
obvious problem would be how to get the people in, in the first place."</p>
<p>"We don't have the technical readouts to the battle station." Lando
protests, uncrossing his arms and placing them firmly upon the table. "We
can't send someone in and expect them to disable any shield it may have
without knowing how the damned things works. Granted the Empire hasn't had
much time for R&amp;D since the last Death Star, but for all we know&#8212;and I
think we've already proven that we know very little&#8212;" Carlissian adds,
going out of his way to glare at Captain Diggs less than amicably, "they
could have been working on improving the Death Star well before the Battle
of Endor. Hell all we /really/ know right now is that the damn thing is
round and it has a really big laser. Sending someone in would be suicide."</p>
<p>Loraiil takes a few steps forward, so he is visible and audible for all.
Then he begins to speak: "I agree with Intel that we should try to get
someone into the Death Star, even if it is only one man to disable the
shields." He takes a deep breath. "The next part of my plan involves an
Interdictor Cruiser. I know it is very hard to get by New Republic
standards, but with its gravity well generators we could pull the DS out
of hyperspace BEFORE it hits Ithor, giving us a tactical bonus: surprise.
Then our man on the DS knocks out the shields and we unleash a proton
torpedoe barrage that rips the station apart. And the Intelligence agent
onboard...well, it would be a volunteer.", he concludes with a slightly
uneasy look.</p>
<p>Captain Diggs glowers solemnly at Lando, his eyelids lowering slightly.
Sure, he's only one officer, but he's still got the reputation of the
entire NRI on his hands right now. "Well, if you have any suggestions on
helping my intel teams get those very plans faster, I'm all ears." Jonau's
expression is hinting at anger now... sure, it's a valid point, but the
intel agent is losing his calm /very/ quickly right about now, "And, I
very much doubt the station was totally designed before the Endorian
battle. Emperor Valak is not stupid. He has already proven that. It's the
very reason we /don't/ know about the sith-damned thing in the first
place!"</p>
<p>Sargent glances around the room, following the ideas that fly around, and
contributing nothing. The young diplomat's personal experience with these
sort of things is painfully limited. With the mention of all the
development the Empire must have been doing, she presses her lips
together, looks down and releases her hands to smooth some non-existant
wrinkles on her pants, before gently crossing her right leg over her left.
The cuff hangs limply in the air. She focuses on the meeting again, hoping
the bit of fidgeting didn't attract too much attention.</p>
<p>Kelvis reaches up to tug his a tentacle, which have started to wriggling
in upset, and confussion. Evacuate the planet, obvious. He pauses, and
swings his head to look at Loraiil, eyes almost bulging out of his skull.
He pulls himself back together, and says, "First, as Mr. Calrissian said,
we don't know if it even HAS shields." He pans his eyes over the entire
group, "The assumption it does seems to be a big one, but wasn't the
shields on the second one... controled from somewhere else?" He shrugs a
bit, moving past that, "I don't think it does have shields, for if it did,
the energy needed to run them would be giagantic, and they wouldn't be
able to use that big popgun of theirs."</p>
<p>Arands leans forward as the newer bridge officer voices his idea. He
raises an eyebrow and is half-worried that the Lieutenant to one side is
going to interrupt the kid. A stern look from Arands is enough to deter
the other bridge officer, allowing Loraiil to speak. Arands isn't too sure
about this 'inside job' plan and his facial expression shows it.  Still,
maybe Squad One could get something together. He nods at the idea of an
interdictor cruiser. Engagement Rule Number One, he thinks to himself:
Fight the battle on YOUR terms, not your enemy's.</p>
<p>"Unless," Diggs offers, still glaring at Calrissian, "The Death Star's
popgun temporarily disables the shield. Which might be beneficial, if
true."</p>
<p>The Admiral pushes through the crowds as he makes his way to the front of
the auditorium. Turning to face the crowd, he begins speaking for his
officers who've been listening and responding to questions patiently for
hours now.  "Midshipman," he addresses Loraiil directly, "that would be a
possibility, assuming we can come across an Interdictor cruiser...at the
moment, however, there is nothing of the sort available to the battle
fleet. Perhaps our friends at Intelligence or the administrators on
Coruscant would like to pitch in." He glances at Captain Diggs with a
questioning expression on his face.</p>
<p>Loraiil , beaming with pleasure that an ADMIRAL condoned HIS idea, pulls
back. Suddenly his comlink beeps softly. Not again, not in ANOTHER
meeting. He listens carefully, and shaking his head, moves toward the
exit, glances back once more, and leaves. Smiling.</p>
<p>Painfully aware that not much more can be decided without a lot more
intelligence work, Luke rubs his forehead and glances distractedly at the
fidgeting diplomat nearby. "Don't risk your men in the covert operation.
Let the Jedi do it," he offers quietly, wondering if he will even be heard
in the noisy reactions of the room.</p>
<p>The young man's words are heard by the intel agent, at least... Diggs
peers at him slowly, "Wo... Would they?" His words are hesitant... and
unneeded. Jonau already knows the answer. He just needs reassurance...</p>
<p>Altair raises her hand, getting an idea that may or may not be ridiculous.
"I don't know how possible this is," she interjects, "But what if we were
to make some sort of diversion that would distract the Imperials away from
Ithorian and draw them to us. Maybe if we started hopping through their
systems...mocking them to find us." For the moment, she doesn't mention
her idea of dressing a ship up as a death star with some sort of frame and
letting it jump around.</p>
<p>Dauthus responds to Colonel Quila with a sigh that sounds more like a
grunt. "Too risky, Colonel. In the time we spend mocking them, they'll
take advantage of five or more undefended systems and make a mockery of
our whole military."</p>
<p>Arands raises an eyebrow. Apparently, Tarroc hadn't yet had a chance to
speak with the Admiral about the idea he had run past Arands a day ago.
Standing up from his leaning position, he walks a little bit out into the
open area in front of his leaning post. "Actually, Admiral, Colonel Quila
has the basis for a good plan." It figures he'd end up suggesting the one
idea he'd insisted Tarroc bring up himself. This almost brings a crooked
grin to his face, but he suppresses it. "What if we pulled a small task
force together. Nothing more than one of our Victory Class Star Destroyers
and two or three gunships for fighter protection. Drop 5 squadrons aboard
and send this VSD out on a rampage through the Imperial systems." He
pauses for only a moment. "It's clear the Empire probably drained most of
its resources to build this thing. Let's continue to strike where it's
weak with a small, fast strike force."</p>
