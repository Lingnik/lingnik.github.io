<p>Log Date: May 21, 2000</p>
<p>Players Involved: Mersche, Vauki, Xanatos</p>
<p>Synopsis: </p>
<p>Background: </p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Mersche sits at the controls, keeping an eye at the asteroid field
surrounding the ship. Though the Triton seems to be in a relatively safe
area of the field, Mersche still seems intent on keeping the ship further
safe. Xanatos had been in here for awhile, until he left, his
spacesickness overcoming him. The woman at the controls looks extremely
angry.</p>
<p>Vauki hobbles into the cockpit, his face still a little sleepy. In his
right hand is a simple mug, with some black liquid in it. Steam pours up
out of the mug, only to evaporate completely into the stale recycled air.
He takes a sip, before stepping further into the cockpit. Gently, he sets
a single palm on Mersche's shoulder, letting out a sigh at the sight
before him...  he had been here days before... and had seen the
destruction first hand. All those people... "Amazingly disgusting." His
words are cool, compassionate, and said without the usual energy that
follow them.</p>
<p>Mersche turns to look and nods, "Yes... yes, disgusting." she says,
looking back out the viewport. "Gastus was a seething hell-hole of despair
and criminals, prime Imperial recruitment land for all sorts of dirty
deeds. Not a target. I don't understand why they would do this." She
ponders for a moment, "Is this why we came? To see this?"</p>
<p>A shrug is the only response. Mege's eyes continue to stare forth through
the viewport the entire time. "I was here when they came... on a cruise
ship with about a dozen other New Republic officers... you might have
heard about it, though it was kept pretty hush. They just appeared, and a
few minutes later, destroyed it... no messages... we fled, right as the
planet was exploding." He shudders, goosebumps starting to form on his
bare skin... "It was horrifying." He snaps out of the remorse, and
straightens up, looking down at Mersche, "I was hoping we might be able to
find something here... some sort of scrap or clue they left behind after
we left."</p>
<p>Mersche shakes her head, "I'm not sure we'd find much of anything. We've
got several thousand klicks of debris out there, and unless the clue's the
size of the Executor, we're going to need a lot more scanners and a lot
more people." she sighs and taps the side of the sensor display, "I can
hardly see anything with all this bio-matter everywhere."</p>
<p>Vauki sighs, closing his eyes to the words... the biomatter... not all of
it plant matter and animals... there were people there. Imperial-loyal or
not, they were people. People who didn't deserve to die like that. He
opens them again, "You're right... there's probably nothing here for us to
see, and it's not like it's going to change... if we need to, the mess
will still be here for us to pick through later..." Pausing, he
contemplates his options, putting together everything... "You said you had
the information on the past two death stars... think you could bring it up
for me?"</p>
<p>Vauki nods, swinging himself into the seat, and setting the mug on the
console. "Alright..." he says to himself, pulling up the page, worming
past the actual photos, and studies the diagrams, papers, and other
informaions intensely. He only occasionally takes his mug up to his mouth
to swallow a drink from it... other than that, he is very focused.</p>
<p>--Some time later--</p>
<p>Vauki sits at the starboard computer console, reading rapidly through
informations about the previous death stars, as well as studying in-depth
diagrams and plans. A half-empty mug of Caf is seated at the edge of the
console, a black ring forming under the mug.</p>
<p>The Refresher door opens, and into the cockpit moves Xanatos. His fleshy
lekku writh on his shoulder, as he mutters. "I'm never flying in Asteroid
Field again without taking a spacesick pill." Bending down, he picks up a
small orange vial, which he begins to place small pills that have
scattered across the floor.</p>
<p>"Spacesick? Ick... never had that. Seen some pretty bad cases though."
Mege continues to stare at his terminal, absorbing as much information as
possible. He takes another drink of the Caf. Outside the ship, the
asteroid belt is no longer visible.  Only a small speck of reflected light
in the far distance gives it away.</p>
<p>Xanatos picks up the pills, counting them. "Sith, must have lost some in
the evasive maneuvers." He shakes his head, slipping into one of chairs.
"Well, since our first location's been spaced, what's the plan?"</p>
<p>"Well... I'm just doing some background research on the previous
stations... hopefully I'll find some sort of correlation that'll give us a
clue where to start." Mege replies, spinning the mug in it's little pool
of Caf slowly. Suddenly, he stops, and turns his head towards the Twi'lek,
"Oh... did Mersche tell you about what our mission is?"</p>
<p>"No.... but I'm guessing, try to find information, or possibly the plans
of the Death Star... Three, right?" The Twi'lek dumps two of the pills
into his hand, popping them into his mouth. "Well, Mersche mentioned that
after the Death Star was completed, it destroyed the planet where it got
all of it's materials."</p>
<p>Vauki nods solemly, a look of utmost hardness on his face. "Three days
ago, while on the cruise ship, the Angry Rancor, with several other
members of the Republic, the new Death Star appeared out of hyperspace,
with a backup artillery of several ISDs, and a large compliment of TIE
fighters in this very system... a few minutes after they arrived, the
Death Star took out the planet. Destroyed it, in one fell swoop...
hundreds of thousands of people, dead in one instant. We managed to jump
to hyperspace just seconds after the planet was consumed in a giant
fireball... we managed to get to Casperian space with a full load of
panicking patrons aboard, and had the cruiser Deliverance head into the
system... our mission, quite frankly, is to find out just how the hell
they managed to slip this station by our intel, find out everything about
it, and bring back her plans..." He sighs, the same cool look covering his
face the entire time he speaks.</p>
<p>"Our Intel didn't know about it?" The Twi'lek gapes for only a second,
before composing his face. "Sounds like they've caught on to who our
contacts are that would know about this stuff.... if we have any." He
holds his arms across his chest.  "Maybe we should start with talking with
our contacts?"</p>
<p>"Most of our undercover operatives, and contacts, that were assigned to
keep an eye out for these sort have things," Vauki starts, "Have
disappeared without a trace. We don't know what happened exactly, if
they're just lurking, waiting for an opportunity to get out a message to
us, or are dead, but we're on our own... we have a couple other teams out
right now trying to get to the bottom of everything... but for the most
part, we're on our own."</p>
<p>"So then, we need to figure out how they found out about our agents, or do
we need to find the plans, and it's location so we can destroy it? You're
loosing me here." The Twi'lek uses a fingernail to scratch one his his
lekku, tilting his head to the side curiously.</p>
<p>"We get the wonderful task of both, if we can manage it. Our primary
objective are the death star plans, with our secondary being the location,
and future locations of it... we have to find it, and rid the universe of
it, before it's too late."  Mege sighs, slowly blinking. "We managed to
get rid of the last two by pretense knowledge about them... the new
Emperor has obviously analyzed his predecessor's failures, and modified
them. I highly doubt he would have let his people screw up again. That is
why it is imperative that we take absolute precautions during our
mission."</p>
<p>"We certainly do." The Twi'lek agrees, "But the question is, where do we
start? Do we have the Transponders of any of the Star Destroyers that were
with it? Do we have a record of the thing's hyperspace vector when it
entered or exited the system?"</p>
<p>Vauki shakes his head solemly, "The crew that was manning the cruise liner
wasn't very... well... let's say they weren't as trained in such things as
we are. We are already compiling a listing of the ISDs, but it's gonna
take time to dig through the sensor logs. For the most part, they just sat
back and watched." He sighs slightly, before continuing, "As for where to
start... I've got a few leads, even if they are pretty damned small. I'm
thinking the lesser Imperial friendly sytems would be a good start. It
might give us a chance to hack into their databases, and see if we can out
anything there."</p>
<p>Xanatos nods, "That's probably a good idea. Perhaps we should see if any
of the other Non-Imperial intelligence agencies have any knowledge of
this? They slipped by our contacts, but maybe not by others? And I'm sure
that we could easily get them to ally with us for this venture.... the
Death Star would prove an equally dangerous threat to them too."</p>
<p>Vauki snaps his fingers, nodding with a sudden gleam of an idea, "You're
right. I hadn't thought of that... if they know anything, we have to get
that information." He swivels in his chair, tapping closed the death star
information, and pulling up the intelligence information on other faction
intel units, scanning them slowly, "It'll be hard to contact them. Most of
them try and keep themselves as closed-mouth as possible."</p>
<p>Xanatos chuckles faintly, "Well, I'll tell you what. Get me to the planet,
point me at a competant government official, and I'll get you guys
everything that they know. Diplomacy and coersion is one of my strong
suits. Shouldn't be too hard to anyway, though we may have to share some
information we get, when we get something substancial."</p>
<p>Vauki nods softly, as he thinks to himself aloud, "I'll have to contact my
sources... see who I can dig up to talk to.  Hopefully, they'll be willing
to cooperate." He ponders for a moment longer, "If we could get the CSA in
with us for at least a bit, it would be extremely beneficial."</p>
<p>Xanatos nods, "Excellent..... CSA?" He inquires, unaware of some of the
organizations out there. After all, he is new to the job. "Might want to
check with our Diplomatic department as well, see which organizations
might be likely canadates to give us some help?"</p>
<p>Vauki nods in reply, "The Corporate Sector Authority... allied with the
Empire, but we have a non-agression pact with them... we might be able to
coerce some of their people to cooperate with us.... as for our Diplo,
I'll try. I know a few people from 'em."</p>
<p>Xanatos shakes his head, a grin on his face. "So, you're going to check
with your contacts.... check what organizations out thee might want to
help us, and check with the Diplomatic department as well, eh?"</p>
<p>Vauki ponders that for a moment, again turning, "You wanna do any of it?"
A grin grows over his face; he's always been known to try and take on too
much at one time. It's gotten into trouble, but he's still good at it.</p>
<p>Xanatos shrugs, "Hey, I can't let just one person have /all/ the fun." He
leans back in the chair, laughing. "I'll take on the last part, just give
me the names? I probably ought to get to know more people in the Republic
then you.... and what's her name."</p>
<p>"You might... I worked in the Diplo corps for a short stunt, though.
But... you may want to contact Eva Sargent... a junior rep for Diplo. She
is capable enough, and would definately be willing enough to help in any
way..." Vauki ponders, sitting his his chair, swiveling in it back and
forth slightly, "There are a couple others, but I'll have to track down
their names again."</p>
<p>Xanatos nods, retrieving a Data-pad from one his pockets and making a note
of the name down into it. "Alright, Miss Sargent." He repeats the name,
before slipping the Data-pad back into his pocket. "Also, before I speak
with her, I should have alittle background information. What other major
powers are there around? I've spent most of my life on Ryloth... And
excatly how much am I allowed to tell them?"</p>
<p>"As far as anyone else is concerned, you're part of the diplomatic corps
of the NR... involved in relaying information to our government for
analysis. You should try and relay your communications through secondary
sources when you can." Mege starts off, thinking to himself for a moment,
"As for major powers... well, first there's us and the Empire... probably
the two most influential in the universe... there's also Caspar, the
Corporate Authority, and the Griffon alliance... a bunch of other little
ones, but they wouldn't know anything. If you need anything else, there's
information in the databanks."</p>
<p>The Twi'lek nods, making a mental note of all the information given him.
"So, essentially I'll be acting as a Liason between the Diplomatic unit,
and the Analyst unit. But I meant, how much can tell them about the
specific information that we're looking for, about the Death Star?"</p>
<p>Vauki nods, "Yeah... just tell them that we're looking for any and all
information we can get on the Death Star. More specifically, try and get
information about whereabouts, and information that might lead us to who
constructed her."</p>
<p>Xanatos nods, "So it isn't terribly restricted." He accepts that, before
realizing that he hasn't put away the vial of spacesick pills. He slips it
into his pocket, before commenting. "So, all that I need to do now, is get
off of the ship and a ride to where I could find this... Miss Sargent."</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mege stands, "I'll take you to her myself. I need to go to
Caspar anyways... see what I can dig up." He wanders towards the front of
the cockpit, plopping himself down in the pilot's seat, and begins
plotting jump coordinates.</p>
<p>Xanatos winces, "Okay.... just try not to shake the ship 'round as much as
What's her name did when we ended up here....  alright?" He quickly straps
himself into his seat, then closes his eyes.</p>
<p>Vauki grins, "I won't. Don't worry... I'm an ace pilot, as it happens." He
smirks to himself, and pushes the slider for the hyperdrive forward
slowly, sending her gently into hyperspace, the streaks of light
enveloping the ship.</p>
<p>--Some time later--</p>
<p>As the console beeps a warning of approaching Caspar, Vauki slowly pulls
the hyperspace handle back, and the lanes of hyperspace around the ship
collapse, leaving the ship in a new system.</p>
