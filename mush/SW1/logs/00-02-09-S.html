<p>Starwars - Wednesday, February 09, 2000, 6:18 PM
------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Wistril system is eerily calm with very little movement through what are usually heavily traveled space lanes. Six of the 7 planetary bodies orbiting the system's lone yellow star are within sensor range of the hyperspace exit point of the small armada. The 4th planet is the only one which sensors indicate lifeform readings on. Small freighters and personal craft appear on sensors as the armada closes the distance.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-2829 flashes from hyperspace just a few meters ahead of the rest of the A-wing squadron it leads. Behind them appear three more squadrons of fighters and then the massive bulk of the Mon Calamari star cruiser. A smaller vessel takes up a defensive flanking position to one side of the MonCal cruiser. The A-wing leader breaks up and away and shields come up as the pilot increases to full thrust.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8242 comes out of hyperspace soon after the head ship. Breaks to the left of the leading ship with a small detachment behind it. The ships all at once increase to there top speed all heading toward the planets. The detachment slowly begins to loosen up, apparently an attacking formation.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8106 appears in a streak of pseudomotion from hyperspace, following several other members of it's X-Wing squadron. Behind it, even more flash into the area. The squadron reforms into a loose diamond position, their shields, weapons, and other gear coming fully online, jutting forward towards the planets.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Realspace is bombarded by even more flashes from hyperspace. A squadron of heavy new republic fighters emerges like a wave of locusts on some dark horizon, perhaps appearing as so many more stars in the night sky. The B-wings dip their largest s-foil below their cockpits, filling out a formation silently and opening their smaller foils for what is obviously going to be a fight. Pushing out ahead of the larger starcraft, they split up into smaller groups.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7062 decelerates out of a flash of light, like a supernova light years away. S-foils splitting open into a more violent mindset with the rest of the squadron. The fighter and it's wingman dip slightly below in the diamond before returning to the tight formation the rest of the ghosts keep.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> CS-9139 Bursts from hyperspace. The Large MC-85 rapidly decelerates, and rotates slightly, realigning to approach the target objective. The engines flare, and slowly the big bulk drifts forward, wary of adversaries.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> As the New Republic task force moves further into the system, a large capital ship appears on sensors, coming from the far side of Wistril's second moon. Sensor readings and computer verification identify it as the 'Volatile', an Imperial Victory-Class Star Destroyer.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> As if already ahead of his own orders, Archer Lead breaks over and down, heading for the planet. The squadron leader keeps the speed down enough that the Y- and B-wing squadron do not fall behind.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8242 thrusters power down slightly as the others come infront in a backwards V, Defensive maneuvers? The ships then do a barrel roll coming down several degree's and then blast off towards the planet. The thrusters are at max now and seems to be catching up with lead at an amazing rate, As soon as they have gained momentum they lose it slowing down to let the lead squadron continue to hold full frontal. The ships already have there weapons power up.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The heavier fighters lag behind only slightly, keeping formation with each other as they stick with the ghosts and rogues. The Y-wings make up the center of the formation, heavier b-wings flanking them in two lines on either side... like a formation parade of troopers passing in review, weapons powered and itching to be used.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8106 follows the lead of Ghost Leader, as the squadron breaks up into three flights, away from the tight formation, each taking it's own initiative as they burn into full thrust, screaming in the general direction of the moon. Each of the three groupings taking up offensive positions.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7062 breaks away with the third group from ghost, rolling down onto the left flank of the b-wings and y-wings, wingman keeping close. The fighter moves to the back of the group, keeping pace with Draco Squadron.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Deliverence starts to readjust it's line of flight, aiming to engage the Volatile. The gunship continues to hang on the flank of the bigger ship, as both ships engines push them toward thier redezvous with the Imperial ship.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatile lumbers forward towards the task force without hesitation. No replies to radio communications issue from the Star Destroyer, nor does it issue any commands or orders. It recognizes the threat of a New Republic attack and responds. After it releases its complement of 24 TIE fighters, its shields come alive and surround the ship in a protective layer.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Appearing on sensors from the planetary surface are more enemy contacts. These new contacts move away from the planet and the Volatile as they attempt to flank the New Republic armada. Sensor readings tag them as Imperial TIE fighters and as they close with the oncoming task force, they bring the total number of TIE fighters to four full squadrons: 48 total fighters.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-2829 over frequency 7468.50: "Archer Lead to Task Force. We have 48 bogies. I say again four-eight total bogies identified as all eyeballs. Archer squadron to engage planetary defenders. Ghost and Rogue, break to engage the VSD's fighters."</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-2829 increases thrust slightly and moves ahead to engage the TIes from the planet. Testing his guns, he fires off two shots of scarlet energy and amazingly tags one of the TIEs from max range.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> All three Ghost flights immediately break off from the brunt of the task force, headed directly for the TIE fighters and the destroyer. The second of the flights, led by Ghost 5, burns forwards in a delta formation.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Deliverence's shield snap up, having launched it's fighters. Maybe it was hoping they not have to be raised, the Gunship follows suit, and the big space cruisers move toward thier deadly game of tag with the closing Imperial ship, chasing thier small escorts.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The small group in the defensive form speed off not taking an ounce of notice at the ships they pass. In an instant the Backwards V soon comes to a full front V and a blaze of lights bombard the planet as all 5 vessels let loose upon the upcoming storm at max range. Then in an instant they break off in to two groups getting ready to box in the enemies from both sides.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7062 rejoins it's flight as the group rockets away, keeping the rear of the other two ghost flights tight.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The heavier fighters continue their move toward the planet, keeping their weapons ready and shifting their formation slightly as to prepare for defensive maneuvers.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The planetary defenders sprint towards the A-wings and the lumbering bombers behind them. They open fire at max range on the A-wings in the lead.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The two squadrons follow suit with their allies attacking the planetary assault force, opening fire on the two squadrons of X-wings heading their way. They do not however scream ahead to engage, preferring to remain protectively about the Volatile.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Deliverence presses forward, closing within max range of the Imperial Victory Class, the massive lasers start lancing out. The Gunship still hangs off the Del's flank, but it holds it's fire for now, allowing the MC-85 to weaken the shields.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7062 has just landed at 5000,5000,5000. (CS-9139)
You paged Adian with 'Take black 2 or 1, like Arands suggested... or ghost/out ghost 9, and use it.'.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> As the A-wings close on the advancing defenders, the lead four TIE fighters break away and scream up and over the attackers. Two fire at the A-wing leader and he jinxes out of the way. The other two try to take snapshots at another A-wing: Archer 9 and his wingman.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 has just entered the system at 5000,5000,5000.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatile is just as anxious to engage the MC-85 as its NR counterpart seems to be. Surprisingly, it charges forward, firing its forward batteries at the Deliverance</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The X-Wings crest out around the TIE's, firing shots when able, and finally fly ahead, in an attempt to fully engage them. Each of Ghost's flights split off once more, leaving six pairs of ships. Ghost 5 and 6 pounce a stray TIE, who happened to be too far from the rest of it's group. Ghost 6 swings around the TIE, blasting it messily, and flies through the sparking debris, Ghost 5 just barely being able to pull up away from it's wingmate. The rest of Ghost squadron seems to stutter a moment, as each get an earful of curses from Ghost 5.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8242 all three ships drop speed to almost stop letting the ships go zooming past them at an alarming speed. They then speed up and lock weapons, letting a barrage of fire escape and knocking out one of the ties. They then continue on there course and in a minute the other two that had left the group show up and let loose upon the remaining three. Now there is only one, all 5 of them chase after the tie but after a moment only the lead ship is following it, obviously the leader wants this kill for himself, The ship does a complete Circle making the shots swirl and head in opposite directions piercing the cockpit and making it explode in a world of debrew and light.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-1608 has just entered the system at 5000,5000,5000.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-9672 over frequency 5123.44: "I take it that's permission to break formation and wrestle?"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Of the remaining planetary defenders, only 13 TIE fighters remain in the battle. Four have charged towards the Deliverance and the A-wing squadron lets them go. When the gunship chews them to pieces, the TIE pilots will realize their mistake. The VSD's TIE fighters are bearing up a little better thanks to the hesitance of Ghost squadron to fully engage them. As a pair of TIEs open up on Ghost 10, it's read shields buckle and the second TIE paints it with green laser fire. The tail of the X-wing explodes in a violent flash.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-8106 over frequency 5123.44: "You got that right. Engage at will."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-9672 over frequency 5123.44: "I got the ugly one!"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Deliverances shields swallow up the dangerous engergy. It's turbolasers continue to blaze out at the Volatile. But now the Gunship starts firing on the Volatile as well, pumping blast after blast of scarlet, and blue energy out at the Victory destroyer.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 Rolls up and away before banking sharply downward at the onslaught of tie fighters and unleashing a barrage of energy needles at the squints and eyeballs.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Bomber squadron pays little heed to the incomming ties right away, continuing on it's course toward the planet.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Archer Lead flies through the thick of the TIE cloud above the planet and dives down into the atmosphere with his wingman. If there are system defenses, he wants to know about them now. The remaining 7 A-wings of Archer squadron continue to engage the TIE fighters</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-1608 Archer 5 streams out with her squadron breaking slightly away she fires swift bolts of energy at the screaming TIE, she misses one bit snags another crippiling it...</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-9672 over frequency 5123.44: "Now i'm depressed... only little ambling eyeballs to play marbles with... anyone else as upset as myself about this situation?"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Those very TIE fighters scramble to dodge the barrage of fire from 9672, as well as the rest of the X-Wings. A solitary TIE jets forward, screaming in the general direction of 9672. It returns fire, missing widely, before catching a spray of blaster fire to it's port wing, sending it spiraling to it's death.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-8106 over frequency 5123.44: "Cut the chatter, Ghost 11. It's child's play, but don't mess up. These are the real things, not sims."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-9672 over frequency 5123.44: "cutting the chatter"</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8242 rejoins its squad of 5 and begins the slaughter of ties. They begin to play chase and kills. The squad lock on a group of three and destroy the entire group, soon afterword all 5 break up and go to fight single battles instead of keeping together.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Subdued sensor readings around the planet alert the armada to the existence of the cargo canisters they had hoped to find in orbit. Revealed are 12 massive containers\; easily the consumables for three Imperial Class Star Destroyers for a year.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-1608 Archer 5 lurches suddenly as the TIE that she thought was crippiled suddenly as a last effort fires back suddenly, it's a chase now with Archer 5 screaming away, fortunetly her wing makes the final blow and Archer 5 is able to shake it off...</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Two TIE fighters lock onto Archer 5's tail and don't seem to want to be shaken off. Both abruptly disappear from the scope however as a calm voice comes over the radio. "Scratch two for Draco squadron. You owe me one, Archer 5." The voice is clearly Lahn's.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 follows the blaster fire it has unleashed through the wave of ties down diagonally, rolling up on it's port wing to cut in behind a pair of TIEs who begin to break for the bomber squadron. A lucky shot to one Eyeball snaps off it's port wing, and sends it careening into the it's wingman. However, another pair of ties doesn't allow the ghost any time to revel in the luck as they splash green energy across the x-wing's dorsal shields. Just barely in time to avoid two more volleys, the fighter rolls starboard and veers off at a strange angle, hoping to draw the ties away. As they fall for the trap, the wingman takes up position behind them, shoving blaster fire down one's tailpipe and forcing the other to break it's attack. "Thanks 12..." The lead is just barely able to get out before seeing his wingman get caught in a heavy barrage and peel out with heavy damage.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatile slows abruptly as it gets closer to the MC-85 and suddenly heaves over, presenting its starboard side to the Mon Calamari cruiser. Suddenly 149 turbolasers and 60 ion cannos fire in pulses towards the Del.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatile slows abruptly as it gets closer to the MC-85 and suddenly heaves over, presenting its starboard side to the Mon Calamari cruiser. Suddenly 149 turbolasers and 60 ion cannos fire in pulses towards the Del.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-9672 over frequency 5123.44: "*noticing obviously the volatile* ok... now that's not right there kids... permission to commit suicide- i mean, hit that star destroyer?"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Ghosts 5 and 6 begin spraying off fire to a trio of TIE fighters, sending the first into oblivion with a few quick shots. Ghost 6, however, again makes a large mistake, as the remaining pair of TIEs split off, he moves towards one to intercept. The other TIE, however, followed closely, gets off two shots towards Ghost 6, which just happens to be enough to send it rocking into the first TIE, creating a massive fireball and debris field. Ghost 5 screams off, heading to regroup with some of the rest of her squadron, the other TIE close on his tail, searing bolts of blaster energy screaming past.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-8106 over frequency 5123.44: "Someone, get this Corellian slime-devil off my tail! I just lost my damned wingman!"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> :snickers into her com as the Draco pilot's shot breaks off her trails, a minute later she is fending a TIE off of another Draco's tail making a clean shot speaking sweetly into her com she bounces back, "Y's up in space are already not a pretty sight, much less one fried..." Soon after she comes into formation with 9 picking off the still ever present swarm</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> A pair of TIEs is cut off from the rest of the group by the Ghost manuever and one gets in several shots onto Ghost 6's port fuselage before the guns of the Gunship shred him and his wingman with laser fire.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-9672 over frequency 5123.44: "i'm on him 5..."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Capital Ship contingent of the New Republic Forces stops its advance toward the Imperial destroyer as laser fire pummels the fore shields of the Deliverance. Rather than concentrating all its fire on the Volatile, the gunship breaks off to soar above the destroyer and begins to take potshots at passing TIEs with its upper laser turrets. Meanwhile, the Deliverance enters into an evasive maneuver, turning to expose its port side rather than its fore to the Volatile. This maneuver has its advantages as scores of side laser turrets and ion cannons on the cruiser are suddenly able to fire clear shots at the Star Destroyer. The space between the two ships becomes a blur of light...</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 throttles up severely, breaking his persuit of another TIE to catch up with Bazil's predator. "Five, this is eleven... Juke left, then roll 180 before diving." The x-wing roars into a nice position behind the TIE as it arms torpedoes momentarily, hoping to divert attention for a split second. Waiting for ghost 5 to move, the fighter, switches back to lasers and gets ready to loose sithfire on the 'corellian slime-devil.'</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8106 does as suggested, the radio crackling with, "Understood." It waits an instant, and then careens to the left, the TIE fighter following almost instantaneously, several bolts flashing past, and into a couple other TIEs. Ghost 5 then rolls, and dives hard, her hull creaking with excitement and stress.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 unleashes a barrage of laser fire on the tie, vaporizing it almost instantly. Not looking to scratch the paintjob, the fighter inverts and dives to come up on 5's wing. "Looking for another wingman... mine's limping home..."</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8106 moves into position with 9672, it's radio again crackling with partial damage, "Nice shot, 11. Yeah, that would be grea&#8212;" His speech is cut off, as a solitary TIE fires a few bolts of blaster fire between the two, and Ghost 5 moves to intercept.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Archer 5 cheers into her com as the VSD lights up, but of course it still isn't over yet still with her wing they both catch a fleeing TIE in thier sights, rolling to the left she snags it as her wing hits her's to the right but gets snagged hard by another just behind.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatile holds it's ground. It's port side batteries start taking shots at the Gunship above it. The starbord side guns continue to blaze with everything at the Mon Cal, but it's shields start to spark and waver from the punishment it's being delt.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 dives and breaks away to cover 5 from a distance as he hunts a few other ties. "I've got you from here..." As the swarm of ties dwindles, more flying room becomming apparent, the fighter tracks another quiet little eyeball heading for his new wingman. "keep doin' what you're doin and don't worry about you're thrusters..."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From CS-9139 over frequency 7468.50: "Attention all fighters...this is Commodore Snunb. If any of you have a free moment and some warheads, target the starboard-side shield generator of the Volatile. We've created a bit of a weak spot in their starboard shielding and now is your opportunity!"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Ghost 5 moves away, before suddenly pulling up hard, around, and around a TIE that had been hunting a solitary Rogue member. The first X-Wing blasts it out of the skies, before moving in with his new wingman, "11, if you've got warheads, use them..." 5 then moves off towards the Volatile, arming her torps, calculating quickly at the targeting vector, and then releases her load.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Archer 5 growls into her com as her wing has to break off her attack, without a wing she scrambles to hit any TIE that she can without getting fried herself. Getting fed up, the com suddenly lights up and she eagerly flys toward the generator cleanly shooting the starboard side.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Draco squadron, for the most part, has regrouped and continues its plunge toward the garrison. Long range weaponry erupt from the first four b-wings, a beat behind the front 2 y-wings. Both sets of fighters roll up and around in order for the next fighters in line to unleash their arsenals, then to follow their leads. This seems to become a trend, a circular trend. The heavy fighters seem to be looping around, each fighter respectively capping off one or two shots when they reach the point in the loop where they have a clear line of fire to the garrison then time to reload the heavy warheads...</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> This time, the Deliverance continues on its path as if unaffected by the barrage of laser fire. All the cruiser's lasers fire in the direction of the Volatile, refusing to yeild for any ship passing through the line of fire.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 clears the two fighters from 5's tail and forms up again, "Oh, just what i was thinking 5..." Torpedoes comming online quickly, the x-wing cuts away and rolls up to come into line with the VSD's Sheild generators and the back of the tower, unleashing the majority of the torps into the globes on the tower before loosing the rest into the aft shuttle bay of the massive imperial vessel</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8106 careens away from the cruiser, her torps depleted. "11, move away from the cruiser. Let's see what what TIEs we can round up. I think the Del can take care of the cruiser." She begins to hunt for more TIEs. Fate, it seems, intervenes, as a pair fire bolts of the energy at the now-alone Ghost ship. A solitary blast hits her starboard wing, sending Ghost 5 spinning away from them.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatiles shield flicker under the pounding, then rapidly fail. The ships engines light up, and it rotates it's good shielding toward the New Republic attack. It tries to orient itself on and outbound vector. It's dimished attack power still lancing out at those ships nearby.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-9672 veers away to mop up.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Continues to fire anything she has as the other Archer form up around her, seeing the X-Wings break off they begin to do the same. Half of the remaing Archers fly to engage the TIE while 5 and the rest continue pounding despite the laser fire</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Seemingly out of nowhere, Ghost 3 comes blazing through space, its quad-lasers blastng furiously. The laser bolts hit the wing panel of one of the nearby TIEs, the small ship quickly exploding, the pilot guiding his ship harmlessly through the explosion cloud.
Atarkin pages: Well, if that's no good, sue me!</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-8106 careens off, the destruction of the first TIE confusion the second, giving Ghost 5 enough time to obliterate the second, seemingly having lost Ghost 11 in the confusion, "Nice shot, 3. I owe you one!"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Deliverance reorients itself into a pursuit course and engages its engines at full speed. Clearly, the Commodore isn't about to let the Volatile get away without some serious engine damage. As the cruiser begins its pursuit, a cluster of charged laser bolts slam into the fore tip of the Deliverance, nearly knocking out shields before auxiliary power is shifted to bolster them. Deliverance's laser turrets target the Volatile's engines and open fire. In the meantime, the Gunship breaks off entirely from the VSD, concentrating solely on TIE fighters as they pass.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Archer engaging the TIEs find that they are having and easier time with the TIEs than the lasers of the VSD, the other group now picks the time to break off as it seems the Del has everything under contol. Now the whole group of remaing Archers help pick off the remaining TIEs.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Volatile pushes all the energy it can into escaping this jaws that are closing around it. As it starts to gain a little ground, an explosion flares from one of it's engines, consuming the device. It's progress slows considerably, but it still limps toward escape, firing at the Del.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Deliverance, still determined to keep the Volatile in system -- perhaps this was a cruel form of revenge for the battle in the Outer Rim two weeks ago -- continues firing concentrated shots at the destroyer's engines.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-6475 shoots off in the direction of the Volatile, coming in starboard, steadying a moment before a pair of torpedos shoot away from its fuselage, hurtling at the engine ports. The ship whirls upwards far before he might it the ship.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Votile comes under more fire, and slow even more as the engines die completely. Fires burst from several places, and soon, the entire ship flares, and breaks up, a few escape pods being consumed in the explosion.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> All of the fighters spontaneously disperse from the fireball -- quickly. A solitary remaining TIE fighter is engulfed, disappearing in an instant. The two X-Wing squadrons begin heading towards the planet and her cargo crates. The bombers, having finished their duties, fly off from the devastation below.</p>
