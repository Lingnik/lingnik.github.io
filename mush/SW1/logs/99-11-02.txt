Altair is climbing out of the her X-wing, pulling the helmet off of her head as the canopy finishes sliding back. She drops it into the cockpit and scrambles over the top of the fighter to the ladder. Sliding to the floor, she runs a finger through her slightly mussed hair, trying to undo the damage of the helmet.

The deck officer looks over the schedule in his hand, giving a shake of his head in negatory fashion. "No Ma'am. Nothing scheduled at least." He looks up, blue eyes regarding her questioningly. "Did you need me to arrange something?" Gabrielle shakes her head once. "No, I'll find something on my own..it's a personal matter.." She replies offering the young crewman a thank you before stepping around him. Well perhaps the Tyd was repaired enough to take for a spin...
