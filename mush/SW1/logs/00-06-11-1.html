Synopsis: 

Background: 

Veuki's Description:
        Prominantly displayed on this man's body is an entirely black
jumpsuit, of some flexible yet stiff material. The material covers his
entire body, save his hands and feet, and the head atop his shoulders. A
solitary stiff black piece of the familiar material is wrapped about his
neck tightly, leaving very little exposed on his body. His feet are clad
in simple black leather boots, while his hands and head remain exposed
completely. The only real thing standing out on him is a simple slap-on
style KIF logo patch on the left breast. The garb seems to have very few
seams, only a solitary visible one residing at the very front, extending
all the way down to the crotch from his neck.
        His skin is well tan, his hands worn and rough. The face is just
as rough, if not more, a solitary long scar running diagonally across his
face, ending in a pink spot near his chin. Various other smaller scars
reside over his young, yet worn, face. The eyes are clear and bright,
shining forth a bright green, striking against the well-ravaged skin. The
scar on his face slices through a piece of his left eyebrow, leaving a
piece of it gone, the hairs having not grown back still. The hair atop his
head reflects youth of an age gone past, tinted green at the tips, and
growing progressively darker to black at the roots. He keeps the hair
straight up, poking into the sky like some sort of surreal cityscape.

Shannon's Description:
Standing before you is a woman who appears to be in her late 20's early
30's. She stands to be about 5'10" and seems quite confident and sincere
in her movements. Her physical appearance isn't what you would call
beautiful, rather average actually.  However, it's the way she handles
herself that makes her attractive. Her hair is brownish in color, though
it appears to be somewhat sun bleached and is cut short. Her hair parts on
the left side and sweeps across her forehead in a slight feathery style.
Her skin is tanned as if someone who has worked in out under a sun for
quite sometime. She's thin with an athletic build, and is currently
wearing a stylish pantsuit with a nice regal looking robe clasped at her
neck. Her pants are tucked into a pair of royal blue leather boots. A
golden amulet is worn about her neck, and rests against her bosom as the
only sign of any wealth she may have besides the ring on the finger of her
left hand. The ring is an artistically designed custom-made wedding ring.
A full carat diamond sits in at the pentacle with a crown of small light
blue star sapphires surrounding it.  Upon the platinum band to either side
of the diamond and star sapphires, are two uniquely cut dark blue
sapphires, which gives that added regal appearance to the ring. She has a
seeming age of experience within her grey blue eyes, and a look of
undeniable intelligence behind them.

==LOG BEGINS==

Coronet Space Port - Coronet City

        This port is busy, like most, but here the hot breath of takeoff
and the deep rumble of engines is closer, more of a feature of the port
than an annoyance. The landing pads and small maintenance bunkers sprawl
across a large open area open to the sky and surrounded by blast walls to
protect the farmlands beyond. Pilots, engineers and techs, mostly natives,
move among the hardware as if at home in the confusing and fast paced
Port. A large complex off to the side houses control functions, transport
authority offices, and the CorSec station.

 &lt;S>outh leads to Trader's Way - Coronet City.

As the CEC shuttle transport touches ground and the doors rise up, Shannon
stands patiently at its threshold. Before the boarding ramp has completely
touched ground, Shannon starts heading down all patiences set aside as she
is very much anxious to get to the races. She had missed her husbands last
race and doesn't intend on missing the next.

With a jolting din, a large rumbling emits from the Triton's open loading
hatch. Slowly, a swoop is driving forth, and onto the ground by an
entirely black-clad man. With only a solitary hand on the steering
handles, he holds a black helmet in the other. Vauki, distrusting of the
public stables, stowed the swoop aboard his ship for the night, to give
himself the comfort of knowing it won't be stolen. Slowly, he pulls it
away from the ship, before getting off, and crouching down next to it,
tweaking a few things on her body.

Movement catching Shannon's eye from one of the ships she happens to pass,
she pauses a moment to glance in the direction of a swoop coming off the
ship. She looks closely thinking maybe she might recognize it, but as the
black clad man exits out of it, she's certain that it is nobody of whom
she recognizes. Thinking that the man may have seen her pause she inclines
her head and greets, "Nice swoop."

Blinking suddenly, Mege rises again, and offers a polite smile, "Thanks.
Not mine yet... but after a couple more races, she'll be paid off." He
runs a hand through the green spikes of hair atop his head, pushing one
single strand of loose hair which decided to make it's home on his
forehead back up atop with the others. As he drops the hand back down, he
pauses it at the bridge of his nose to scratch the large scar that stripes
his face.

Shannon looks at the man, his appearance certainly different from anyone
elses she's seen. But being the business woman she is, she's always
encountering different forms of species so doesn't judge anyone by thier
appearances. She nods lightly to him then asks, "Which level are you
racing in?"

And his appearance definately /is/ different from anyone elses. The
multitude of scars, the piercing green eyes, the green stuck-up hair. Like
some sort of colorful holovid exploding in one's face. "Me? Just lowly
grade one... was my first time, actually." He grins softly, looking the
woman over briefly.

Shannon's smile broadens, "Ahh, well its to be commended. I'm told you can
make some good money if you are good in your catagory and win that
particular race. I've known several people who have done well for
themselves with swoop racing. I wish you all the luck."

"Thanks... yeah. First prize in my division's a ship and twenty-five
grand." Mege shrugs softly, before swivelling himself atop the swoop's
back, pulling a pair of black leather gloves from the helmet, carefully
slipping each on, and strapping them tight, "Not like I'll win, though.
I've already raced, and am at third place... so far. Got a good score for
my first time, though... hopefully I'll do better next time." Smiling, he
shifts his eyes between the gloves and the woman as he pulls them tight.

Shannon smiles kindly and winks, "I'm sure you'll do better next time. It
was probably the newness of the track that got you this time. Of course,
being in 3rd place is nothing to sneeze at either. I'm told you get a good
sum at 3rd place as well, and that will start you on your way of paying
this beauty off for you no doubt." she says gesturing towards the swoop.
Taking note that the man is preparing to leave she steps aside with,
"Again, good luck with the races. I'm sure you'll get a good handle on it
an do quite well".

"Thanks, m'am. Name's Mege Vauki. Team KIF. Good luck yourself, and enjoy
the races." With that, Mege carefully pries the helmet out of his hands,
and slips it onto his head, clasping the locks into place. Keeping the
visor up, he keys in the startup sequence, revving the engine. After a
moment of making sure everything is in order, he waves, "Cya." The visor
is played down, and the swoop swivels on it's axis, jutting off towards
the south amidst the foot traffickers and other obstacles.
