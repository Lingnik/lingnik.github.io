Players Involved: Howie, Bazil

Synopsis: 

Background: 

Howie's Description:
  Human, he's definitely human and could even be a typical Corellian if
there is such a type. Standing at six feet tall, give or take an inch or
two, this man a short military cut brown hair and clear brown eyes. His
built isn't massive and big but he isn't a stick-like lanky person either,
pretty much evening out in between. This man looks to be in his late
twenties, a chiseled face of experience and is unmistakably etched into
his expressions. For now he seems to be exhausted by trying to hide that
fact from others, from his physical appearance. He still stands tall and
proud of who he is and what he belongs to.

  He is currently wearing a navy blue fleet uniform, golden buttons
running up the middle to hold the uniform in together.  The uniform has
the appropriate patches and decorations in place to signify that the
wearer of this uniform is located in Fleet Operations and the Captain of
the Deliverance. His rank pips inform you that he is currently a Captain
of the New Republic Navy, with two little badges showing that this man
participated in the battle of Endor and Bakura. He wears a black belt that
fashions a silver clasp, fitted against his waist, keeping his matching
navy blue trousers on. One his blue trousers is a pair of new looking
Corellian Bloodstripes running up the sides. An occupied blaster holster
is fitted through the belt, along with an extra pouch for an assortment of
things.

Bazil's Description:
        This man's overall appearance is that of a typical, yet boring
one. His complexion is tan and slightly worn, signs of wear drifting from
place to place. His height is, once again, average; assumed around five
foot nine or ten. His yellow-brown eyes blend in with his brows and the
mop of frazzled short hair atop his head. His face is clean shaven, with
little sign of any hair growing thusly.
        His clothing suggests a civilian; a simple light green tunic under
a loose fitting deep grey coat. A simple band of gold chain is tucked into
the tunic, the end, hidden from view. Tucked, mostly hidden from view,
into the left pocket of the dark coat, is a small datapad, turned off,
with only a single corner revealing it's existance. His loose black
slacks, almost canvas in texture, give little notice of anything in
particular, with little to conceal underneath. Black leather boots cover
the remainer of his body, coming up to his thighs, and laced tightly.

==LOG BEGINS==

Starport 115 -- Military Headquarters

        Devoid of the mass of civilians that clog the many public
starports of Coruscant, Starport 115 is quiet in comparison. The landing
area itself is large enough to accommodate ships up to the size of medium
transport. Once the ship is landed and offloaded, military personnel guide
the ships to their assigned hangar bay. The open area of the landing area
extends down a narrow strip along the north WALL.
        A large section of the main floor to the south is actually a large
lift which is how many of the ships are moved to hangar bays on the lower
levels of the Starport. Of the ships housed in hangars on the main level,
most are government and military vessels, but a few civilian vessels are
also located on this level. As expected, there is a strong military
presence everywhere in the starport.

In the midst of some rather extravegantly decked out civilian ships, is a
tiny microfreighter, her hull quite pristine and new, no dings or
scratches beckoning over her hull. At the rear, stands Bazil McKenzie,
decked out, as usual, in his civilian attire, his upper body crammed into
some small hole on the outside of the tiny vessel.

A nice looking New Republic shuttle starts to descend from the sky of
Corellia, usually bright from the activity in the sky or the lights from
taller buildings that are around. After the shuttle descends, the ramp
lowers and soon after that, the Captain descends from the ramp accompanied
by two honor guards. He gives both guards a nod and tells them that they
can have a little fun on Coruscant until he is to return. The shuttle's
ramp rises again after the Captain departs at the vessel takes off.

For no real apparrent reason whatsoever, Bazil, who's body resides mostly
inside the ship, gives a sudden jolt, a loud *CLANG* ushering out from
within the beast. Shortly following that is a loud, "FARK!" As well as a
long string of curses, in various languages from the universe. The words,
however, are distinctly those of one Bazil McKenzie, former XO of Ghost
Squadron...

What the... Howie's ears perks up as he hears the loud clang and curses,
seeing a Microfreighter berthed on the restricted landing pad. "Now who's
ship is that, he sounds familiar." Howie muses to himself as he heads
towards the micro freighter.  Moving up the lowered ramp, he stands by the
entrance way and knocks on the durasteel wall. "Hello?"

"Thrice farked, mother-of-a-sith force-be-damned ship!" Bazil utters,
before crawling out of the ship, his hand already rubbing at a spot on his
head slowly. He blinks, turning at the voice and the knock, moving himself
around the corner of the vessel to peek out at whoever or whatever it is.
Recognition set in immediately, and Bazil grins widely, offering, "Howie,
you sand-devil, I'm back." He comes out fully, wandering towards his
former Captain.

Seeing and hearing Bazil, Howie only shakes his head and grins, "I thought
that was you Bazil. Only someone like you can curse up such a storm,
making the Tatooine Sand Storms jealous." He nods slightly, "Yes... I can
see. Welcome back Bazil... I don't know what you did to tick off Intel and
the High Command, some illegal activities I heard but I promise I won't
turn you in if you spin me a good story." He continues to grin however as
he leans against the wall, "So... who is this lovely lady?" He asks,
looking around the ship.

The pilot grins, placing a solitary hand on the hull of the ship, "This
little girl is the Dawntreader. Just brought her in a few hours ago...
she's mine." Bazil beams proudly, almost as a new father would. Had Bazil
had enough money to purchase something like this before? Who's to say...
but on a pilot's salary?

The Captain doesn't question about how the pilot had the resources to
purchase such a fine ship, knowing Bazil will tell him if he wants Howie
to know. "She is a beaut... Dawntreader, a rather beautiful name. You
better not go running through Imperial space, guns abalazing since you
named her such."

"Heh, not likely. She's only got a single laser." Bazil starts, pondering
lightly to himself, before adding, "I named her the Dawntreader for a very
special reason, Howie," McKenzie peers over at the hull where his hand is
stuck firmly in place, before running it down the side, as if feeling the
curves, "Means the beginning of a new journey. A new life, so to speak...  
my time here did teach me one thing... time is short. I haven't the time
anymore to worry about things like I used to. I'm moving on, I guess..."

The Captain only nods at that, "A new beginning, new beginnings are always
good. Just don't leave your old friends behind..."  With a light chuckle,
Howie nods in agreement, "Yes, time is indeed short and thus I have done
what I have done. Bazil, I need your help. I need to visit a few jewelry
stores, would you like to come?"

"Sure thing, Howie. Lookin' for a present for Miss Heretin?" Bazil
inquires lightly, drawing forth a small rag to wipe the yet-untarnished
grease from his hands; work on the ship having already shown evident on
the man. He wipes at where his hand touched the hull, as well. As for
Jasmine, well... that was definately public knowledge that they were going
together.  Slowly, Bazil taps at a small control panel outside the ship,
the alphanumeric keys being slowly pressed, just enough to be caught by
sight as 'tatooine'... the loading ramp slowly withdraws, and closes the
ship completely, giving evidence to it's entirely box-like shape. As many
have called it... a flying box. But, it's /Bazil's/ box, so in his mind,
it doesn't matter.

The Captain is silent for a moment, not musing over the fact that everyone
knows about him and Jasmine, he doesn't mind about that. It's what he's
saying next that will shock Bazil, perhaps even give him a heart attack.
"Bazil... you know me right?  I'm definately not good at picking an
engagement ring, ya know? I was hoping you could... well, help me at
this." He grows silent again as he waits for Bazil's reaction.

If someone managed to stick a camera in Bazil's chest, they'd probably
think someone paused the output. His heart stops, his breathing stops, and
blinks. Just blinks. Twice, in fact. His face remains quite fixed, the
globes of eyes fixeated on Howie's, reading his face mentally, "En...
engagement? You're ..." Alright, so Bazil is at a loss of words right now.
He can't even formulate a simple statement or question right now.

The Captain only grins as he sees Bazil's reply, stunned, utterly stunned.
That's quite amusing to Howie actually as he nods, "Yup. I popped the
question out of the blue, I don't know why. I have been thinking about it
a lot but I was totally unprepared when I asked her. We had a nice long
talk afterwards, about how she is from a traditional family and whatnot,
that I have to talk with her brother first. Well, I get another chance to
propose to her when all goes well, so I have to be prepared."

The distraught, lost, and stunned look is then warmed over, a smile
appearing over his face, as he approaches Howie a bit, "Well...
congratulations, guy." Bazil reaches a solitary arm out to pat Howie's arm
slightly, "Damn good luck to you..." He grins, and offers a half-smirk,
"So, who's the best man, eh?" A wink is shown forth from the man.

"Thanks Bazil... I guess it's time for this Rogue Captain to settle down
eh?" Howie replies with a grin before listening to the question, trying to
hide the smile. With mock seriousness, Howie looks away and appears to be
thinking, "I don't know...  I don't know who would like to be my best man.
I met a small Jawa a year ago, I think he can do. I don't know who else to
choose."

Bazil smirks, and playfully hits at Howie's arm, "You scoundral. You'd
better pick me, 'less I convince Altie to throw all of Ghost into strike!"
The word 'Altie' is very uncommon for Bazil to speak... in past times, he
would only refer to the Colonel by rank, or Altair. Had things changed
since then, or is it just a slip of tongue? "C'mon, let's go find you a
ring."

Laughing, Howie just shakes his head slightly, "Of course Bazil, of
course. I haven't had the opportunity to acquire friends like you, to be
able to have those guy to guy talks and stuff. You'd be the perfect
target." He pauses however as he notes Altie refers to Altair, "Nice
nickname for the Colonel, hmm?"

Well, there goes the neighborhood. Mentally, Bazil is prodding himself,
wondering where /that/ particular nickname came from, "I suppose it's
better than Jawagirl, eh?" He winks, moving over to Howie's side, and
patting him on the back, "C'mon. I know of some great places near the
capital."

"She'd slap you if you called her Jawa girl. Heck, I knew her for a long
time and I know she'd slap me to." Howie laughs at that, Jawagirl, she
would be soooo angry. Proceeding towards the lift that will bring them to
the main level, "So, does she know you're calling her Altie?"

"True, true... very true. I only just found out about her jawa lifestyle a
few days ago..." Bazil offers, before adding, "And yeah, I think I let it
slip a couple times the other day. We had lunch up at the White Knight,
and then wandered over to Menrai for a while."

Pressing a button as they enter the lift, Howie nods slightly, waiting for
the lift to reach it's destination level. "She acted like that during the
big ceremony for the Admiral, most interesting. She explained it all
afterwards though." He pauses and arches a brow, turning back to Bazil,
"Lunch huh? And Menrai? Very nice I must say... you're not doing too bad
yourself."  He gives Bazil a grin and a side elbow to the gut.

"I just... it was only... I mean..." Well, fark. Bazil has definately dug
himself a nice grave /this/ time... he didn't /mean/ for it to come out
sounding like a date, or something like that, but sure enough, it did, "It
was only lunch, Howie.  To catch up, you know... it's been a while since
we talked."

Hah hah hah, Howie gives a triumphant laugh as he manages to pry out some
information Bazil like an Intelligence Ace. "Gotcha buddy, no need to
explain. I can keep it hush hush if you want. And be proud of what you do.
I know it's to catch up and stuff, don't worry. Friends could lead to
something bigger..."

Bazil opens his mouth to speak up, moving his hand up in the air to insert
an objection. It was innocent. Honest. Sure, Baz has a crush on Altie
that's bigger than the Death Star, but, well... what's there to say? He
likes her, there's no denying that fact. "Yeah..." is the only word that
he manages out, a look of consternation flooding over his face. He /wants/
to argue, but deep down, he knows it's not going to matter. He can't deny
that he likes her...

"Don't worry Bazil... lets get this ring thing over with first, then we
can work on you and the Colonel if you want." Howie replies with the same
grin as he waits for the turbolift doors to open. When it does, he steps
out with Bazil, "No, you know a few good jewelry stores? That is good
because I know... none. Price isn't a problem, swoop racing and years of
saving up my salary can take care of that."

Still trying to get over the fact that Howie thinks he and Altair had a
date, Bazil ponders to himself for a moment over what Howie says, before
replying, "Well... uhh... I think there are a couple places over by the
capital... haven't been there for a long time, but I'm pretty sure they're
there."

"Alright then, lets head there. I haven't exactly visited Coruscant either
so you know more than I do." Howie replies with a nod as he proceeds
through the lobby of the New Republic Military Headquarters, nodding to a
few officers that pass by.

"Luckily, Intel let me be to wander the planet between hearings, and all
that. I was actually starting to settle down, in case they found me
guilty..." Bazil shrugs, walking alongside Howie, his eyes remaining
completely unfixed, though just attentive enough to know that he is,
indeed, still following alongside Howie.

"Tell me Bazil. Truthfully." Howie replies as his pace is a casual one,
relaxing too. "What did you do to get Intel on your back?" The Captain
doesn't turn to look at Bazil when he asks the question, focusing in front
of him before he is able to wave down a robohack for the two, so they
don't have to walk for hours.

A smirk floats over Bazil's mouth, as he ponders lightly to himself. He is
still so unaccustomed to leading two lives... the fact is that he never
really was down here for as long as everyone said. "You know the moff,
Morganna, that we were carrying around in our brig for a few days before I
left?" Bazil starts, peering up to Howie, his eyes finally focusing, "They
thought I was out to kill her. Don't know what gave them /that/ idea...
maybe it was because of the incident with Altie, me, an' Kierv..."

A small nod is made by the Captain, "Understood, Bazil. So how are the
hearings going then?" He asks after stepping into the robohack, waiting
for Bazil to get in so he can give the destination to the computer. "If
there is anything I can do to help your case, just tell me and I'll do
it."

"Oh, the hearings are all over, actually..." Bazil offers, as he slides
into the seat next to Howie, "Final hearings ended four days ago. Found me
not guilty, of course... they never could figure out why I was pinned in
that position, anyways. I appreciate your offer, though..."

Releasing a sigh, a sigh of relief Howie nods, "Good... I'm glad because
if you are found guilty, then it is my fault as well for not making sure
everyone knew of the order to avoid the cell. So you are back on duty
then?"

Bazil shakes his head slightly, "Not yet. On orders to wait a few more
days before going back on duty. I've got my commission back, though...
they even bumped me up a notch. Lieutenant Commander, as of three days
ago." He grins, and peers over at his friend, "Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?"

"Lieutenant Commander McKenzie... yes, most facinating. But I still think
Captain Darklighter has a better ring." Howie replies with a grin, "And
congratulations on the new promotion. You can afford more as in gifts for
the Colonel now, yes?"

"Or Lieutenant Commander Jasmine Darklighter, eh?" He grins, and elbows
Howie playfully. Nearly gagging at the last comment, though, Bazil tries
to regain his composure, "Well... err... thanks... and... uhh... I...
well..." He shakes it off, and continues, more straightforwardly, "She and
I are... acquaintances... and yes, I do like her. I just don't know if the
feeling is mutual."

Howie laughs at Bazil's reply, nodding slightly, "I think that sounds
okay. Much better than Lieutenant Commander McKenzie, definately much
better. He remains silent for a few seconds as he listens to the broken up
reply, "Good, we can work on that.  I hope your trip to the mountain was
as fun for her as it was for you. I could also try to find out for you,
the Colonel and I are old friends."

A grin falls over Bazil's lips, and he nods, "It was alright... and sure,
if you'd like to." He shrugs, and leaves it at that.

The robohack continues to cruise along, heading towards it's preplanned
destination. "Good, I want to wish you best of luck.  Just spend more time
with her and take things slowly. Does she know of your... infatuation with
her?" Howie asks with a grin.

"I... think so... I'm not quite sure. I haven't actually gone out and
/told/ her... that I remember, anyways." Bazil shrugs, peering out the
window of the vehicle, onto the cityscape around.

The robohack begins to slow and and descend as it reaches it's
destination, the Captain looking out briefly. "Perhaps I can find out for
you, how she feels. Would you like me to tell you of the outcome?"

Glancing away from the window, and towards the floor in thought, Bazil
nods slightly, before turning his gaze back up to Howie, "Yes... please...
that would be... wonderful. If you don't mind, that is. I don't want to be
a bother, or anything."

"Naww... no bother. I'm interested to see how this goes and I want things
to work out between you and the Colonel." As the robohack lands, the
Captain slips through the appropriate amount of credits before opening the
door and stepping out.

"Thanks a bunch, Howie... I'd really appreciate it." Bazil follows suit
after Howie, stepping out from the vehicle, and onto the large platform
that suffices as a square... even if it /is/ suspended several thousand
meters above ground. Businesses exist all around, and people mill from
place to place.

"Most interesting... this place is most interesting Bazil. I have never
been here before." Howie replies as he takes a look around, seeing the
safety barriers around the outside, deciding not to go to the edge to look
down, "Well, lead on then Bazil, you know best."

Peering around to get his bearings, Bazil ponders, "If I remember
right..." the vehicle that bore them here takes off, and disappears off
into the distance, "It's off this way." He motions with his hand, pointing
towards a small cluster of more lavish stores.

"Alright..." Howie nods as he begins to make his way towards that side of
the square where the smaller lavish stores are located. And there is a
jewelry alright. Illustrious Jewels. "Well, there it is indeed." Stepping
into the entrance, the doors open up, revealing a rather extravigant
store.

"Never actually been in here..." Bazil opts quietly to his companion, as
they enter the luxurious interior. Quite rapidly, however, a suit-clad
woman wanders up to the pair, and inquires, "Can I help you gentlemen
today?"

OOC: We both had to log off, and never did get to finishing the RP.
