<p>The solitary shuttle Intrepid glides unhindered through the sky, her engines whining softly. It swerves midair, and touches down softly on the ground, in a quite graceful manner. After a few moments, the engines idle down, and the rear hatch opens. A solitary human steps down the walkway leading from the rear of the ship. Bazil, trussed in his familiar flightsuit, greets a passing technician, and puts him to a few tasks of working on the ship, while several crates are loaded into the ship's hold. The pilot, Bazil, meanwhile, takes a moment to rest, and look around.</p>
<p>"So this is Sluis Van, huh?" the man mutters to himself, before letting out a sigh. His emerald gaze glides over the landing field, and a half-hearted mirk appears on his face. Slowly, Quirn moves forward, boots thudding against the ground, before he comes to a stop, almost in the middle of the field. Running his hands through his hair, he smirks further. "Not quite like the brochure..."</p>
<p>Ambry walks quickly through, paying no attention to where or towards whom her steps take her, attention is focused entirely on something hanging in the air before her, her brow furrowed. One wrong step sends her bumping into Bazil, "Oh, sorry!" she exclaims, and then, "Pilot?" the furrowed brow smooths, and one eyebrow shoots up when she asks the question.</p>
<p>A blink, and sudden appologization from himself as well is returned, "Excuse me. Sorry about that." He offers a small smiles, and nods momentarily, "Yeah. I'm a pilot. Name's McKenzie." He shows a quick glance to his flightsuit.</p>
<p>The smirk transforms into a smile, though not without its own touch of arrogance, as Quirn catches a glimpse of the collision. Giving his short hair another flick, he begins to stride over to the recently landed Shuttle, and the two figures nearby.</p>
<p>Quirn's eyes settle on the figure of Ambry, as he nears the group. He gives a slight nod to her, still bearing that irrepressible grin, and then gives a side-glance in Bazil's direction. He remains quiet though, just listening to the conversation, and doesn't seem at all fazed by his own rudeness.</p>
<p>"Ahh, Coruscant, you say? I'm going to be headed there in a few minutes, as soon as my shuttle here is filled with her cargo. I could take you there when I leave, if you so desire?" Bazil questions in return, a simple acknowledging glance directed towards the oncoming man. He nods briefly, before turning back to Ambry, awaiting an answer.
The technician who has, during this time, been working on the shuttle, steps over to Bazil, and motions a few words at him, "Sir, your ship is prepped. The last of the cargo is being loaded now."
Bazil nods briefly in return, not even bothering to turn his head to the man, "Thank you."</p>
<p>Ambry's smile widens, "Ah yes, that would be wonderful." she responds, returning brief nod to Quirn before settling arms across her chest, "Now, then?" eyebrows raise once again as the technician informs Bazil that his shuttle his ready.</p>
<p>Lahn comes from behind his fighter, two technicians following him, "Sir, your fighter is fully fueled and ready for launch when your ready." the pilot responds, "Understood, thanks for da work..." he says, nodding and waving them as they part.</p>
<p>Bazil nods momentarily, "Yeah... you can go ahead and stow yer stuff aboard the shuttle, if you want. It'll be a few minutes more..." Crates, still being loaded on the shuttle. He then turns to Quirn, "Can I help you, sir?"</p>
<p>Ambry nods her assent quickly, and with another smile, enters the ship.</p>
<p>Stepping back a pace or two, Quirn tilts his head to look toward the shuttle, and then back toward Bazil. He pauses a moment before answering, and smiles.. "No.. no thankyou. At least not unless you shall be here for a while longer, which I don't think is the case. Although..." he pauses once again... continuing after a few more seconds.. "Which passage should I take to reach StarOps?"</p>
<p>"StarOps?" He repeats, and thinks to himself for a moment, "Well... normally, I'd have you talk to the Commander... but he's on one of our ships right now, and I'm a little busy right now. I should be back later tonight, if you'd like to speak then?" He inquires, noticing that the crates have finally been loaded.</p>
<p>Quirn nods his head, and smiles.. "That'd be fine.. though of course, uh.." he gives the Landing Field another quick look around, and continues.. "What should I be doing in the meantime? Just.. get used to the base, and do my own thing? Or.. " he shrugs both shoulders, and then raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Bazil thinks to himself, "Well... I think there's a bar around here somewhere. If you can find another StarOps pilot, you could talk them into helping you out." He offers a quick shrug, "I've never really looking around Sluis."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll let you get on with your.. work?" he offers a smile, and then fidgets a little with his stance.. "Besides, its never a good idea to keep a woman waiting. I'm sure I'll find the bar just fine.. I got a.. um.. nose.. for finding those sorts of places." he gives a final wink, and then starts to turn away.</p>
<p>Bazil nods, and waves after him. "Name's McKenzie," he shouts out quickly, "Bazil McKenzie."</p>
<p>Even as he walks away from Bazil, he turns around and continues to walk on, albeit backwards. "Irascius Quirn, myself. Good meeting you."</p>
<p>Bazil nods in return, and steps aboard the shuttle.</p>
