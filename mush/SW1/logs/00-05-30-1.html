<p>Log Date: May 30, 2000</p>
<p>People Involved: Vauki, Zeak</p>
<p>Synopsis: With a bit of frustration, the team is kicked off Dreven, with
only a little bit more information than when they left... particularly
knowledge of a huge fleet orbiting the planet.</p>
<p>Background: After only being on Dreven for a few hours, the team is
rounded up to the starport, only to meet Zeak...</p>
<p>Zeak's Description:
He is wearing a thick armored flight suit. It covers his whole body,
except his his head, under a set of black metalloid pieces which sit on
top of a black flight suit. Tiny servo motors have been placed in it, to
help it's wearer move about unencumbered. An thin armored box on the front
holds life support, as well as radio equipment. On his right breast, a
dark insignia, almost untoticable indicates this individual to be an
officer in the Imperial Navy holding the rank of: Commander.  A blaster
sits holstered flush against his left abdomen, and a short range weapon,
but more powerful than the blaster sits holstered against his right thigh.
Anything heavier would sit in or on the light backpack slung on his back.
A flight helmet, again coated with armor, sits on top of the outfit. It
resembles the normal TIE flight helmet, except that it has a single eye
piece that extends around his entire frontal viewing arc, and is a bit
taller than normal. The helmet is black, and completely obscures the
wearer's identity.

<p>Vauki's Description:
        A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face,
worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of
scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his
upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn,
threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other
locations.  Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very
loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests
loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump
created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a
pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which
rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of it
is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the edges
of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas holster, in
which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming softly under
any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black leather, almost
militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no shine, and reach
nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost
scoundral-like demeanor.

<p>Landing Field - Admiral Bevven Spaceport
Admiral Bevven Spaceport, named for the first commanding officer of the
Dreven Sector Group, is busy and active as usual.  Uniformed ground crew
guide incoming vessels of all sizes to their assigned stalls, while
departing vessels are queued to the south after a thorough customs
inspection. Much of the view here is obscured by high gantries and
terraces to the south, and the cliffs which surround the Spaceport to the
east and west. At the north end of the landing field is a large domed
structure, which houses the main concourse of the spaceport. The standard
of the Empire is draped over the Grand Archway there, flanked by an honor
guard, greeting all who pass through the gateway arch into the new jewel
city of the Empire.

 &lt;N>orth leads to Main Concourse - Admiral Bevven Spaceport.</p>
<p>The crew of the Triton had been assembled over the last hour, the
last parts of her put back together. Her 'captain' is being held as a
'guest' of the Empire outside by a pair of troopers. While they are not
being forceful, they make it clear that if he moves, there will be
consequences.
        Down the ramp of a recently landed lambda strolls Zeak . . .
covered in his heavy field armor. He looks over the troops then begins
approaching the Triton.</p>
<p>Standing there, in the midst of the pair of guards, Mege glowers around
slowly, making quite sure his disapproval of the current situation is seen
by all. He almost eminates a blood-red anger. His eyes flick onto Zeak
suddenly, and follow him.  He makes not a single sound, content in his own
ways to simply glower.</p>
<p>When he gets within a polite distance, Zeak finally speaks, his voice
distorted slightly by the helmet com, but not enough to remove the extreme
agitation he is feeling at something or some one, "You and your crew are
here by ordered to leave the system. I don't know what you intended to
smuggle off this rock . . . but I don't have time to deal with it or you."
As he speaks two troopers begin loading some familiar looking containers
into the ship. "You will find you ability to navigate unimpaired again,
and your cargo intact . . . I don't care where you go but if you come back
here you will be afforded neither the chance to land or jump out. Do you
understand me Captain?"</p>
<p>"I understand completely, /Commander/." Vauki responds quite
diplomatically, save for the final word, which is emphasized quite
harshly. "I don't think I'd want to come back." Finally, Mege seems to
relent his bad mood, and takes on a more nicer tone of voice, "I apologize
that I and my companions were such an inconvenience to you... I thank you
for the repairs you offered, though." The change in mood might actually be
seen as sickening... for one so blind with rage to suddenly become so
friendly and warm.</p>
<p>"Your ship has been cleared through traffic, an escort will meet you in
space," Zeak continues, his tone slightly less harsh. "You are to jump as
soon as you clear the well." With that he turns and signals to the storm
troopers who with him begin to withdraw.</p>
<p>Mege nods softly, his stance taking a more relaxed position as the
troopers move away from his vehicle, "Thank you again, so much, for your
assistance... I'm very glad we managed to fall into your hands. Better
than having to be stranded for eternity." A smile plays forth on his face,
and he bobs his head out of respect, "Farewell, Commander."</p>
<p>Being in much too foul of a mood to be polite, not so much at the Captain
but at his superiors for the repremand he recieved for not following
orders they never gave, Zeak ignores the man's civility and continues to
walk away. He stops and looks back only when he and his troops have
cleared the saftey marker for the ships ion engines.</p>
<p>Vauki almost shrugs at the lack of response, and he himself turns towards
his ship. He trods forth, the rest of his team already aboard, and makes
his way up the loading ramp. Slapping at the control panel as he reaches
the top, the ramp slowly withdraws into the ship, melding into the mess of
components. After a few minutes, her engines begin to burn fully, dust
floating up around behind her.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7584 has just entered the system at -282,-180,-19.</p>

<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7584 lifts up through Dreven's atmosphere, finally struggling
out, her ion engines burning brightly amongst the other vehicles nearby.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> As the YT-1300 leaves the planet's atmosphere, four TIE
Interceptors take up possitions about it, nudging it on a course directly
away from the moon, out into space in preperation for it's jump.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7584 follows the TIE/I's politely, if a bit sluggishly, her
engines putting out as much power as they possibly can. She seems a bit
more stable than the last time she took flight, if anything, though...</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Interceptors give the freighter a little more space as it
clears the gravity well. They hold their courses though, waiting for the
vessel to jump.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> Almost as if showing off, the freighter sluggishly barrel rolls,
adjusts her course slightly, and, without another warning, disappears into
the void of hyperspace, leaving behind a soft flash of light. Any operable
navcomps might actually discern her destination as Tatooine.</p>
