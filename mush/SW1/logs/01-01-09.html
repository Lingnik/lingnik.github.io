<p>Log Date: Jan 9, 2001</p>
<p>Players Involved: Jasmine, Bazil</p>
<p>Jasmine's Description:</p>
<p>"She is a short one, I'll tell you that much." is often the comment of a person describing the young woman you are looking at. Her skin is a milky white, rather pale for a normal human, but that might suggest she spends her time indoors, or is not allowed to stray. Her hair is a golden blonde, not colored in any way. It seems to be well cared for, and looks soft to the touch. Her eyes are a piercing green, but at times you could swear they were blue, and overall they are large and innocent looking. Her hands are small and delicate, yet very skilled, and her feet are tiny, her legs an average length, and her walk is graceful. If one were to pay close attention, you might notice that her toe hits the ground before her heel, showing a manacured upbringing. Her endowment is amble, leaving one so interested with a feeling of wanting to look again.
      She is currently wearing:
      A long black flowing velvet dress with golden buttons all the way down the front. 
      A pair of black velvet knee-high boots, with 3 inch heels and a zipper down one side.
      A beautifully crafted choker with a dangling pink heart jewel.</p>
<p>Bazil's Description:</p>
<p>Standing fully at a rather average height for a human, this man imposes a calm and simple appearance. Fair skin, marked with several small scars darts his face, very little in the way of other blemishes marking him. His hair is a lightened brown, freshly cut, and waving unkempt around his head, just short enough to stay away from his brows and ears. Brown eyes match the hair, slight tints of yellow streaming through in tiny intricate designs, completely natural. His brows and lashes are a dark black, well kept, except for the brows, which flow forth from just above the edges of his eyes, tapering back into a diluted point. Soft dark shadows covet themselves beneath the globes, circles just slightly visible before they fade out of existance halfway past his eyes. The nose is simple, and unpronounced, the sides slightly poking out from the rest of the roundish figure. No facial hair is borne over his face: his chin, lips, and beneath ears kept well shaven. Simple, yet full, lips cover his face, the only other noticible facial feature on him. The rest of his body is kept in well shape, from what can be seen. Musculature on his body is kept to a minimum, though well defined and toned to meager strength.</p>
<p>His legs are covered in dark sandy colored cargo pants, with a matching belt around his waist. Pockets rest over his knees, and in the other /normal/ spots. They hang loosely from him, drifting with the wind casually, giving hint to their /very/ thin fabric. His feet are covered in greybrown shoes, which come just under the joint of his foot. As for a shirt, he bears a black dress shirt, streamed with pearl white buttons. The shirt is tucked in to his pants. As for his belt, it bears a solitary blaster, and an ornate sword.</p>
<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>Upper Viewing Gallery
Balcony-like in design, this viewing gallery affords each occupant a perfect and unobstructed view of the entire Amphitheater below. The stone walls are curved in such a way as to allow for nearly flawless acoustics, giving one pause for thought about the Massassi and their civilization. Sturdy wooden benches have been placed here, perfectly preserved, making it possible to seat an innumerable amount of spectators.</p>
<p>&lt;'look view' will afford you a full view of the Amphitheater.>

                  -=-=-=-=-=&lt;&lt;Visible exits>>=-=-=-=-=-
 &lt;D>own leads to Amphitheater Entryway.</p>
<p>You peer over the railing to see..
A series of four flagstone steps descend into a concave area that serves as the stage. Totally circular in design, the vastness of the room is overwhelming. Lush vines have grown over the rim of the structure and into the inner portion of the building, cobwebbing the upper walls. The sunlight floods the stage like a large spotlight, and one must wonder if the Massassi had that precise effect in mind when they constructed this place. Overhanging galleries provide spectators a full view of any portion of the floor.</p>
<p>Jasmine climbs up to the top of the balcony and looks around in awe. Quite a wonderous place this is, one she had no idea of it existing from the view of the shuttle that whisked her here. Her high peeked curiousity pulls at her from every direction, but she keeps walking to her destination. Her presence could be easily detected as her loud heeled boots clank on the flooring. She walks up to right before Bazil, but not too close as she is still a little worried about the sudden call. "Bazil? You wanted to see me?"</p>
<p>Turning suddenly, Bazil peers towards Jasmine, his face quickly giving her a once over, as if she were someone he had, quite simply, never met or seen before, "Jasmine." He smiles softly, "Thank you for coming... I'm sorry it was so sudden... it's just... I..." His smile sort of falters, and he stumbles over his words, peering behind him at the rest of the amphitheater. Pursing his lips, he waggles his brows, trying to figure his choice of phrasing carefully. It was never his best trait. Never. The dim moonlight from above floods into the entire structure, causing an erie blue haze throughout the place, just enough fog throughout the place to light the area for sight. "I found something... something I had never expected. Something /entirely/ confusing at first... I..." He offers again, peering out across the spanse of the room.</p>
<p>Jasmine blinks at Bazil confusedly. She has not a clue what he is getting at, and had come here only because she was hoping that Bazil held information about Howie. Otherwise, she would have been far too scared to come out here. "What is it Bazil? I am not following you at all."</p>
<p>Bazil frowns outwardly, "Jasmine... it... it's not about Howie. If you're wondering... it... It is about you." He turns slightly, and sits down on the edge of the balcony, "You... your parents... they are gone, right? Do you have any siblings?" He peers curiously towards the young girl before him. He was nearly a decade her elder, and yet he felt almost as close to her as he had to Howie, or Altair.</p>
<p>Jasmine gulps visibly, her cautious look replaced by one of blind-sided sadness. "Yes. Both of my parents are gone. I lost them to the Imperials on Calamari." She no longer looks ahead, her gaze now at her feet as she fights the strong emotions that well up when her parents or Calamari are mentioned, let alone at the time time. She gulps again and says in a barely audible voice, "I did have a brother once, before I was born. Even though I did not know him, I missed him greatly." She coughs, still holding in a lot. "Adian was the brother I had lost. He helped me through a lot trouble."</p>
<p>Solemnly, Bazil nods in response, "Did your parents ever tell you... of this other brother?" He seems concerned now, his eyes showing sympathy. He reaches out with one arm to touch hers gently, compassionately. Poor Jasmine.</p>
<p>Her body seems to shudder at the touch. Jasmine's body looks like it will crumble at any moment. "No, they did not wish to upset me. It seemed to hurt them to talk about it as well. I suppose it was the best for me."</p>
<p>Nodding slowly, Bazil peers off towards the rest of the amphitheatre slowly, lowering his hand to his side again. He then begins speaking again, quietly, almost at a whisper, "I grew up on a slave colony in the Tatooine system. I don't know if I... or Howie... ever told you. I had grown up, raised by a woman who was my mother... and a man who was my father... my father... he was... the owner of the colony." He lowers his head slightly, peering towards the stage far below, "I grew up, as a slave... managed to finally get out, though. Killed my father." And then, he sighs, peering up towards the wide ceiling of the room, "A few months ago... maybe longer... I went to Tatooine to track down my mother. She was in pretty bad shape... but she told me a fantastical story. One that I never expected." He purses his lips, before turning his head towards the woman, "They were not my real parents." He lets this deluge of information settle in, first.</p>
<p>Jasmine shakes her head, still looking at her feet. "No, neither of you speak much of the past, I guess with good reason. I am glad you got out of there, but you did not deserve that. You were meant for better things." She idly stubs her toe on the floor, listening to the echo.</p>
<p>Bazil nods softly, peering towards the stubbing of toe, before he continues, "I... I've been searching for my parents for the past few months off and on. I had a small team of my agents probe further into the matter a weeks back... and they came up with positive results." He looks up, eyes peering towards those of Jasmine, studying her face, "I found my parents... or rather..." He pauses once more, before adding, "Who they WERE. As well as who the rest of my family IS..."</p>
<p>Jasmine stops her stubbing as she feels her feet being watched. She looks up and blinks as he talks, nodding slightly. "Even though my parents are dead, I would not ever wish to not know who they were. I am sorry you did not know your parents." She sniffles a bit, and squeaks for no apparent reason. "At least you found some family, yes? I am sure they will be happy to find you too."</p>
<p>"I would dearly hope so. Otherwise, this entire trip, this meeting. It was all in vain, and I ought to have stayed back on Tatooine lately... I left to come here, Jasmine. I left the chance to look at the plans of the /Death Star/ to come here. To find my baby sister." Baz peers towards Jasmine's face again, hoping to instill understanding with this. It was far more important to find her, than to ever look at some computer-generated diagrams of a space station.</p>
<p>Jasmine nods slightly. Her cluelessness is rather famous, no matter how book smart she may be. The point Bazil is trying to get to hovers just ver her head, and perhaps she should have gotten bigger heels to catch it. "That sounds like it is very important. I hope you find the happiness you seek. Force knows you deserve it, Bazil." She goes back to stubbing her toe again, all she needs is to twirl her hair at this point, huh?</p>
<p>Bazil just stares at Jasmine with a blank expression, sighing softly, "Jasmine, I don't know if you can understand this now. It was all very confusing for me... I had time to absorb all this new knowledge. Not only are my adoptive parents gone... but my biological ones as well." He takes a step forward, peering down at her softly, "And I have a sister, who cares more for people than anyone I've ever seen. And though I've known her so long, I don't think I've ever really met her until now. This moment. Right here." He ponders holding up a neo-flash sign stating, "JASMINE HE IS YOUR BROTHER."</p>
<p>Jasmine looks up at him and blinks, her face holds the expression of a confused and possibly in pain little girl. You can almost see the gears grinding and sparking inside her head as the information assaults her brain. "Right here?" she asks, half actual question, half not. "But that would mean..." She blinks again, "I do no understand." Her knees buckle and she falls agaisnt Bazil.</p>
<p>Bazil oofs, taking her up into his arms, and slowly lowering her onto a nearby wooden bench, crafted meticulously through fine handmanship, and having survived all these years. Slowly, he just kneels beside Jasmine, peering at her, pressing a hand against her face, "Jasmine... you don't have to understand it all right now... I am sorry I told you like this... I just thought it would be the best way... away from everybody... twenty seven years ago, I was taken from our parents, and ferried off to those mines on Tatooine. I do not know why, and I suspect I never will. All I know, is that it has taken me my entire lifetime up until now to find you... my sister." He sighs, moisture coming to his still-human eyes, despite the other inorganics in his body, and a solitary tear drops from his face, "I am sorry, Jasmine. I did not mean to hurt you or anything..."</p>
<p>The small body shivers as if she were freezing, her eyes are closed and she seems to be deep in thought. "Our...parents?" she squeaks out amidst her troubled thought. "I, but." she stammers out. "Brother?" She starts to rock on the bench and curls up into a fetal position. "Mommy, daddy." She spits out in her ramblings, "Bazil?"</p>
<p>Bazil just sort of goes into a slight panic, peering at his newfound sibling with pity and sympathy. He reaches out tentatively, to place a hand on her shoulder, "Jasmine... are you alright?" At this moment, upon noticing the shivering body, he kicks himself for not bringing the one thing he ought to have on this dim planet&#8212;a blanket. Or, at the very least, a coat. The only thing of comfort on him was a small flask of whiskey&#8212;not that it was exactly comfort. But it deluded one into thinking it was. He holds off for now. Perhaps try to talk her out of this... get her to be rational... stop rocking... He then makes a movement, something so little used for him. He reaches out with both arms, and embraces the woman.</p>
<p>She had called out his name, because in her whirlwind of emotions, something stood up and asked for him to comfort her. She needs support, especially now that she has learned and is trying to digest such a great ammount of painful information. After what seems like a dreadfully long silence, she finally gives in and sobs into Bazil. The only way she knows how to deal with anything in life is a strong support, and a lot of crying.</p>
<p>Bazil just peers off into the distance of the amphitheater quietly, simply holding onto her, and letting her drip all over him. What was there to say? It was painful, even for him, who rarely cried. Right now, however, was one of those rare moments, tears slowly sloping off of his face, and onto her head. "It... it's okay... it'll be alright..." Is all that he manages to get out, pondering. It was strange, finding out. One of those 'I've known this gal for years, and just found out her parents knew mine!' only... her parents /are/ his.</p>
<p>Jasmine cries for what seems like hours, at least to her. She has by now throughly soaked Bazil's clothes in her weeping. She quiets for a moment and then shows signs of life. She hugs him instinctively, and opens her eyes. She sniffles and looks up at her. Unexpectingly, she forces a smile and says, "Are you sure you really want to be my brother?" She sniffles and squeaks quietly, "I am told I could be a handful..."</p>
<p>Smiling as she finally calms down a bit, and speaks, Bazil nods, "Are you kidding? I'm absolutely sure. You /are/ my sister... and not even you could scare me away from finding the truth. And if Howie can handle you, I'm sure it can't be that hard." He smiles, motioning a hand to wipe at her face slightly, moving the tears aside, "Besides. We were meant to find each other. I'm sure of it. Somehow... something... it made this happen. I don't know why. It just... is." He offers a crooked grin, "Besides, I've got to have someone to take care of crazy old me, and keep me out of trouble, don't I?"</p>
<p>Jasmine smiles a little wider and rests her head on him gently. She closes her eyes and makes what sounds like a purring sound. "It will take me a while to sort this out. This is a lot for me to figure out." She takes a deep breath and exhales. "I am going to need your help to do it. I hope you can handle the job. I already take care of you as it is." She smiles and snuggles.</p>
<p>Bazil continues his own smiling, pressing her against him slightly, "I know. I will help... as much as I can. With the... Death Star plans... so recently obtained... I'll be able to take time off from my duties in order to be with you... and hopefully soon I will have a chance to chase Howie down, and drag him back to you. After all, I'm sure he'd love to marry you as soon as he can." He grins profusely, memories poking through back to the endeavour of finding her a ring on Coruscant.</p>
<p>The man shivers slightly himself, and peers down at Jasmine's head, "Let's get out of this cold. We can stay here tonight, and then head back to the Chancellor, or wherever, tomorrow morning. I have my ship here... I'll take the couch in the lounge if you'd prefer." He ponders quietly, "You know. It is really weird having a sister." How eloquent.</p>
<p>Jasmine nods slightly, shivering a bit as she calms down and realises how freezing she is. "I will be here, you do not have to stop your plans for me. Those plans are very important, so you can get your work done and then we can take some time off to relearn each other..." She sighs and shivers into him, trying to get some warmth.</p>
<p>In return, Bazil simply nods. Several years ago, he had joined the NR, without a second thought, in search of someone, as a way to escape from his problems. And now, here he was. He had found friends, family, and truths that would never have become evident to him before. A strange evolution, to say the least, for those that know him. "Come on... let's get back to my ship before the moon sets, and we freeze to death out here. I, for one, prefer the scathing temperatures of Tatooine as to these frigid temps." He adds, quirking the edge of his lip slightly, "I can only imagine how much I would dread Hoth." He moves to stand, then. He doesn't mention that the planet could be home to violent evil creatures.</p>
<p>Jasmine nods and shivers at the thought, and the chill already setting in. "I agree. I much prefer the warm oceans of Calamari to this cold. "Do you have a comfy bed?" Her tone is partly joking, but somewhat serious. She is spoilt afterall.</p>
<p>"Psha!" Bazil offers in reply, standing quietly, and noogying the girl on her head softly, "It's a mere bunk, but it's definately cushy, and by far better than anything on the Chancellor!" He smirks, peering towards her, moving to help her up, "Why, back on Tatooine, I had to sleep on the dirt at night!" This, of course, in jest, even if it is rather true to point.</p>
<p>Slipping an arm around Jasmine, he starts down the strange mysterious construction again, peering at its wonder, "I'll have to find out what this place once was, one of these days." Yes. One of these days. After destroying the Death Star, killing the Emperor, saving Howie, liberating Coruscant and Calamari from the Empire, and saving billions of others. Well. One of these years, anyways.</p>
<p>Jasmine huffs back at him, "My bed is very comfy I will have you know. You do not think I would let them give me just any old bed do you?" She squeals at the noogie but doesn't fight back. She looks around before they leave, and she nods in agreement. "This is a lovely place, I agree. We should definately come back. I think it must hide a number of interesting treasures.</p>
