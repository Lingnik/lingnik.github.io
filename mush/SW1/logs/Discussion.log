Dayna Raises her right brow as she watches Lianna storm off. Dayna raises to her feet as well and walks the short distance to stand beside Xan. She decides to stop trying to figure the girl out and turns attentionto the twi'lek. "If there's anything else I can help you with, please don't hesitate to ask", she says with a smile.

"Don't ask." Xan says, regarding Lianna. "She just has a personal grudge against our prisnor, I believe." His head turns towards Voren, "Excellent, thank you. If anyone asks, the camera black out earlier today was just a simple mechanical failure, alright?" Then again, his turns back to Dayna. "Yes, there is. Do you happen to know if there's a lounge, or someplace to relax around here? This is quite some interesting information to go over."

Dayna nods slightly and gestures to the lift. "There's a mess hall..and I believe a lounge area as well upstairs." She grins broadly and turns towards the direction of the lift. "Shall we?"

Voren_Nadil says, "Well I'm going to the Guest Intel Station. I shall be there if anyone needs me going over this information. In my report to the boss, I have a few strategic suggestions to make to the navy guys about planning for our next offensive based on this information. I dont know how good my advice is but I think it has some merrit."

You press the lift call button.
The Interdeck Lift -- NRSC Deliverance arrives and the doors open.
You step into the lift.

Interdeck Lift -- NRSC Deliverance

	The lift for the NRSC Deliverance is a fairly large one, as to accommodate the large amount of crew and passengers. The walls have been painted a silvery color and are unadorned, except for the large symbol of the New Republic. On the right side of the front wall is the lift panel, which will direct the elevator as to which of the many different decks to go to. The floor is a dark, marbled color. As with everything else in this ship, the elevator, even in its simplicity shows the professionalism that is always present in the New Republic.

Ship Services -- NRSC Deliverance

	Here, in what can roughly be considered the center of the ship, a long deck greets your eyes. This is the Deliverance's Ship Services deck, where the crewmembers live their daily lives. Along either side of the deck, signs denote the various billeting and mess areas, as well as a few recreational areas. Additionally, a wide ramp drops down from here, with a sign above it denoting the presence of medical services.
	Several counters can be found towards the aft end of the deck, where small purchase shops are available. A ramp opposite the medical leads up towards some more mess facilities.

Voren_Nadil steps out of the lift carrying a datapad and he is followed by a another man in an NRI uniform. The other man is pushing a small hover trolley that holds rows of data cylinders. A guard escorts the two people due to the nature of their cargo.

You head forward into ...
VIP/Guest Quarters -- NRSC Deliverance

	A long corridor with a dozen doors to either side. Two Naval Security officers are stationed at the near end of the hallway, while two more are visible at the far end. Several bulkheads at that end of the corridor give the security officers excellent cover should a firefight ensue.

Voren_Nadil enters VIP/Guest Quarters -- NRSC Deliverance

Voren_Nadil walks into the corridor and flashes his ID to the naval security guard at the door. He heads about twenty feet down the corridor and turns, entering the Intelligence Section.
Xanatos nods his head, "Exellent." He follows into the guest Intelligence Section. "Excellent indeed. Don't suppose this place happens to be stocked with any spiced wine, is it? A glass sounds good right about now."

Kathryn enters the corridor from Ships Services.
Kathryn has arrived.
Kathryn enters VIP/Guest Quarters -- NRSC Deliverance

Voren_Nadil smiles upon hearing this and walks over to the small refreshment area in the corner with the coffee pot and other small items. Under the counter he pulls out a few bottles and sets them down on the counter. "Corellian Ale, Calamarian Wine, Corusca Gin, and some really bad Bespin ale. I wouldnt touch the stuff, however."

Turning a corner, Kathryn strides down the corridor with a young bridge officer. "Oh yes, ma'am." he answers a question unheard, "The messages from your husband have been forwarded from your apartment to your assigned quarters and a secured datarod in the intelligence wing."
The woman nods approvingly, allowing herself to smile as she continues to walk along.

"If I may ask," the young man inquires, "do you enjoy your quarters?"
Kathryn grins, "Oh yes, of course. They're very nice. Thank you for your assistance, Officer. If you'll excuse me, I have work to do."
With that, she slides her identification through a slot and enters the computer area.

Dayna chuckles softly as she steps a little further into the room. "Not in here, Xan. You'll have to go down to the mess hall for that." She plops down on one of the plush couches provided in the room and leans forward, her forearms resting on her knees. "Let's see what you've got, Xan." she remarks as she gestures to the files in his hand.

Voren_Nadil smiles upon hearing this and walks over to the small refreshment area in the corner with the coffee pot and other small items. Under the counter he pulls out a few bottles and sets them down on the counter. "Well, you could go to the mess hall or....Corellian Ale, Calamarian Wine, Corusca Gin, and some really bad Bespin ale. I wouldnt touch the stuff, however."

Xanatos snorts lightly at Voren's choices. "Calamarian wine then." He hands ove the data-pad towards Dayna, "Remind me we need to pick up some Velorain spice wine from Caspar on our next trip there." He sits himself down on the couch next to Dayna, "Found out a good deal about Admiral Cimbar."

As the doors hiss open, the white-robed woman slips into the computer area and is greeted by one of the Deliverance-stationed internals with a smile, "Why, good day, ma'am. How was your honeymoon?"
Kathryn shrugs a bit with a grin, "Went well, things been hectic here, I hope?"

The man grins back, "Oh, yes ma'am. I hope you have a few hours and some coffeine. That's just looking at your message inbox mind you."
Kathryn emits a low-level groan as the internal grins and walks back to his station, "Good luck," he says quietly in passing.

Voren_Nadil nods and pours two glases of Calamarian wine, one for himself and one for Xanatos. He stands he puts one in each hand and walks over to the couch, taking a seat as he places Xanatos's glass on the table for him. After this he takes a small sip and leans back, pullout out a data cylinder and puts it in a small hole in the table, the middle of the table is made of a small glass lens. It begins to light up and a picture appears, one of Cimber. It rotates slowly. The background of the picture is on some imperial planet as Cimber gives a speach before a group of academy graduates.
You say, "What an ugly man..."

"Admiral Cimber, is quite an intesting man." Xan explains, "Rather interesting way of determining tactics. What he does, is he studies the art of various species to learn the way they think."

Kathryn says, "He wasn't much of a student if I remember him correctly either."

Kathryn moves closer to the holographic table, "Nearly tried to commit him, but Senator Cimber would have never allowed that kind of thing to happen to -his- family." She holds a mug of coffeine close to her as she stops at a good proximity."

Kathryn moves closer to the holographic table, "Nearly tried to commit him, but Senator Cimber would have never allowed that kind of thing to happen to -his- family." She holds a mug of coffeine close to her as she stops at a good proximity.

Voren_Nadil nods and looks at the picture again. He looks back to his colleagues, "Did I mention that I think he is rather ugly?" He then looks back to the picture while taking a sip of his drink. "I fear it is not going to be possible for us to attack Dreven without heavy loses. I think Selene is our best bet."

"Actually, I don't think we should attack Selene either. That's what they'll expect... us to hit the lesser of the two forces." Xan obseves, taking a sip from the wine. "See if you can pull up any other Imperial worlds, that would we could get a hit and run attack in at..."

Kathryn simple takes a swig of her coffeine, not offering a planet that could be bombarded. She seems to have her eyes intent on Cimber, though the anger isn't as bad as it would be if that was Lexington Atticus floating there.

Voren_Nadil frowns and thinks for a moment. "What if we strike the relatively undefended naval station at O'paal. Besides our rivals at Bofo are stationed there. We could say hello."
Voren smiles broadly and takes another sip of his wine.

Kathryn hrms and strokes her chin, "O'paal would be a bit of a better target, yes... and though most of the fleet is in orbit of Dreven, the Eevie fleet is normally at O'paal and they were shown to be one hell of a good fleet at Bespin."

She takes another swig, "OSG also contains a few other key things the Empire wouldn't like to see incenerated. It's a good target, especially now."

Xanatos takes a small sip of his wine. "What if we sent a few hit and run attacks towards Tandoshan, Kessel, and Athaniss? They appear to be the least guarded planets. And the Empire would need to reposition thier fleets to better defend thier planets if it seems like we might be invading one of them. They'd almost have to take away from either the fleet at Drevern or the one at Selene."

Voren_Nadil frowms and says, "What you say has merrit but I think the OSG is too ripe a target to pass up." He looks to Kathy for confirmation.

Kathryn nods deeply, "I agree with both of you, that either one could either cause great damage to the Empire or lessen the security of the Death Star. There are drawbacks. The attacks of their planets may be seen as a ploy to lessen security of the Death Star, and they may ignore it, they are the Empire, after all and Trandosha is just full of non-humans, so that's one I think they wouldn't really care about. Attacking and possible destroying the OSG would be a grand victory, but just might give the Empire enough gall to take their five-thousand ship fleet and the Death Star to Calamari, or Corellia."
"Both have their good sides and bad. It is up for the Navy to decide, honestly."

Voren_Nadil shakes his head, "No no. The Navy has the final say in the decision but its our job to think this one over and then relay to them out points on both side of the argument so that they can make a more educated decision."

Kathryn nods, "Of course, all-in-all, they will still decide how they will go about any operations."

Voren_Nadil nods and says, "Well yes and I would want them too. I can't plan out the tactics of a naval operation but we can all think of the psycological strategies to the overall picture though."

Kathryn nods and sips her coffeine.
