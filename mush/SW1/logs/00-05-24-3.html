<p>Log Date: May 24, 2000</p>
<p>People Involved:  Marcus, Vauki</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Marcus' Description:
        Before you stands a human of about 20 years with short black hair
and deep green eyes. His build is on the small side, being only 5' 2"
tall, and is thin, weighing about 110 pounds. He looks around with a
slight smile, looking just a bit shy. He wears a blue, loose-fitting shirt
and black denim jeans. On his feet are a pair of worn work boots, and he
wears a black leather vest over his shirt. On his hands are a pair of
fingerless gloves, a sturdy belt around his waist. Over it all is a brown
leather longcoat with a high collar, and on his head he wears a black cap
made of worn leather with plates of dull grey steel rivited to the front
and bill. He seems to be the carefree sort, almost always smiling or
laughing, and his posture is relaxed.</p>
<p>Vauki's Description:
        A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face,
worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of
scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his
upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn,
threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other
locations.  Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very
loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests
loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump
created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a
pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which
rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of it
is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the edges
of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas holster, in
which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming softly under
any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black leather, almost
militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no shine, and reach
nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost
scoundral-like demeanor.

<p>Spaceport -- Imperial City</p>
<p>The Imperial City spaceport is one of a countless number of
spaceports that litter the surface of Coruscant like craters on a moon.
This particular spaceport, the largest, is a multistory complex built atop
a triad of towers which loom over all adjacent buildings like a
mythological giant. Of the spaceports myriad of hangars and areas, none is
more pivotal than the CUSTOMS and Immigration area near the gated exit. Of
all the other connecting accessways, most link the main spaceport with
smaller, private hangars or storage areas. New Republic soldiers stand at
each of these accessways, friendly and congenial, but always on the alert.</p>

 &lt;W>est leads to East Republic Ave -- Imperial City.</p>
<p>Marcus 's whistling a tune to himself, leaning against the wall of a
nearby hangar and chatting with a starport technician.  He looks over as
the YT-1300 lands.</p>
<p>With slow deliberation, the worn-out Triton pushes through the sky, and
touches down on a nearby landing pad. Her legs compressing up into her
body slightly, she decompresses, sending jets of steam and gasses into the
air. Finally, after a few moments, the entry hatch lowers, and out walks a
man, dressed in grungy civilian clothes. The only thing that /doesn't/ fit
this picture, is the expensive Kylan-3 blaster fitted onto the right side
of his waist.</p>
<p>Marcus watches you walk down the ship's ramp, then checks his chronometer,
nodding to the tech and stepping away from the hanger to look around. He
returns to watching you, tipping his cap back and scratching under his
chin.</p>
<p>From his position, still partially under the Triton, Vauki's appearance is
hazy. He's obviously tired... even though the sparse light in the
spaceport gives very little of him away. Slowly, he steps through the hazy
mist being emitted from his ship, and onto the pad. Yawning, he stretches,
and then plops himself down, right there, on the edge of the loading ramp.</p>
<p>Marcus checks his chronometer again, then steps into the hanger he was
standing next to, emerging a minute later and walking towards you. As he
gets closer, he calls out, "Hey there! You look beat... Want some coffee?"</p>
<p>Vauki simply blinks, he /is/ beat. "Sure..." Vauki calls out, as best he
can. Hiw ship behind him, dark, but lit slightly from her own hull lights,
and those of the pad, cast an eerie glow with the mist floating around. On
top of the mist, it's also a cool night, and the moisture in the air has
condensed lower to the ground... causing a strange layer of fog that hangs
gently on the ground. "Thanks..." he offers, a few moments later, to the
other man...</p>
<p>Marcus nods and hands you the cup he came out of the hangar with, when he
gets close enough, "Not a problem. I'm guessin' you've been flyin' some
long hours..." He leans against one of the ramp lifts, "What's got you
flyin' in here so late, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I got a message to pick up someone for a mission... thought I'd sit down
to rest a few minutes 'fore setting off to find him." Obviously, Vauki
doesn't know who the man is, from the look of things. He also manages to
let it slip that he's not just your ordinary civilian. He accepts the cup
of Caf thankfully, and takes a sip, "Thanks. I needed this..."</p>
<p>Marcus chuckles, "You don't say... Well, maybe I can help you find this
fellow? I know a lot of people around here, workin' with the techs and
such. What's his name?"</p>
<p>Slowly, Vauki reaches behind his back, and pulls forth a small datapad,
tapping it to life, as the phosphors burn brightly in the night,
illuminating the front of his body... he strokes it softly, and taps
again, pulling up the file, "Some guy named... err... Delvennis. A tech."
He rolls his shoulder slowly, stretching, and takes another drag of the
Caf, "Damned controllers didn't even bother to send a picture this time."</p>
<p>Marcus hmmms and fishes in the pockets of his coat, muttering, "Delvennis,
Delvennis... Hmmm... Sounds familiar..." He pulls a card out of his pocket
and hands it to you. It's a New Republic ID card, with his picture and
full name, "This the guy you want?"</p>
<p>Vauki nearly chokes on the Caf in his hands, and the mug almost falls to
the ground, as Vauki peers between the card and Marcus, "Sith... I didn't
think it would be /that/ easy to find you. Teaches me for not doing a
standard check on a target /before/... Intel, eh? You don't look it... oh
well. I guess I never thought we'd be hiring kids like you." Vauki, nearly
eight years Marcus' elder, looks /quite/ older than that. At least
mid-thirties, by the wear on his face.</p>
<p>Marcus chuckles at your reaction and nods, "Yah... Marc Delvennis, at
y'service." He tips his hat to you, "And it helps that I was expectin'
ya." He looks around, "So, when do we leave?"</p>
<p>Vauki recovers in the time it takes him to stand. Still carrying the mug
of Caf, he shrugs, "Got your things? I'd like to leave ASAP. Rest of our
team is asleep... you'll be working right away, from the look of things,
too." He tucks the datapad back into his trousers, his arm brushing the
blaster at his side. A yawn is ushered forth from his gaping maw.</p>
<p>Marcus nods, "What you see is what I got. And don't mind what the card
says... I'm just a tech in disguise." He starts up the ramp before
pausing, "Speaking of which... Can I have my card back?"</p>
<p>Vauki chuckles, tossing the card back, "Hide it. I'll get you a new one,
for undercover use." He grins, and winks, "We're headed into Imperial
space." With that, he himself heads up the ramp, taking the mug with him.
If they want it back, he'll just give them a new one when he returns... if
he returns.</p>
<p>Marcus catches the card and stashes it away, grinning, "Oh goodie... I get
to play with Imperial toys..." Marcus lets you pass him on the ramp, then
follows you up, hands in his coat pockets.</p>
<p>"Death Stars are no toys." Vauki replies solemnly&#8212;the knowledge of the
Death Star had been common knowledge to traders by now... and higher ups.
But, given that most intel assignments are kept classified until they're
started, it's probably highly unlikely Marcus would even know that that
very piece of Imperial technology exists again. As he passes Marcus, he
keeps his attention straight ahead, not bothering to peer upon any
reaction.</p>
<p>Marcus blinks, "Death star? There's another death star?" He's a bit
shocked, to say the least.</p>
<p>Marcus enters in a code and enters STARFIGHTER: Corellian YT-1300 --
Triton
Marcus has left.</p>
<p>Marcus 's shock disolves into a grin as he turns to you, "Please tell me I
get to slice a Death Star computer terminal."</p>
<p>Vauki nods softly, as he enters the ship, "Yes. It destroyed Gastus
exactly one week ago. Horrible atrocity. Our mission is to find it, and
get the plans." Turning, the man slaps a panel, closing the hatch, before
his attention returns to the tech, "Yeah, you do. Good luck. You'll need
it... Oh." Vauki extends his hand, "Name's Mege Vauki, for now. You'll be
running in their systems to find the plans, and hopefully anything else
you can."</p>
<p>Marcus turns solemn and nods, taking your hand and shaking it, "Pleasure
to meet you." He sighs, "Destroyed Gastus, eh?  Never been there..." He
takes his cap off and runs his fingers through his hair, "Ok, gotta get
the plans. I can do that."</p>
<p>Marcus leans against a wall, putting his cap back on and crossing his
arms, "I'm thinkin' you need sleep, yes? I'll save the rest of my
questions until after you've done so. Fair?"</p>
<p>Vauki sighs, nodding softly. "Yeah.. I watched it go down in flames.
Hundreds upon thousands of people died, in that moment." He shudders
softly, "Yeah... that'll work. We're headed out tomorrow..." With that, he
heads into the common area, yawning expansively.</p>
<p>Marcus nods and follows, "Just show me my bunk and I'll be a happy
techie."</p>
