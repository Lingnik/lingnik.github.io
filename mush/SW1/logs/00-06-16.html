Synopsis: 

Background: 

Altair's Description:
Altair appears to be in her early twenties. Her hair hangs at that
annoying length between too long and too short, right around the
shoulders. It is currently pulled back into a ponytail with only a hint of
a wave. In an attempt to seem more Caspian friendly, she wears a Black
Krayt Swoop Arena baseball cap. It is a dark grey color, with a picture of
the Krayt chomper eating a swoop on it. It is the same picture that is on
the cups sold at the arena. She has a sprinkling of light freckles across
her slightly upturned nose.
As a member of the Ghost Squadron she wears a dark grey flight suit and
some light armor. It has a patch designating her as a member of the
squadron on her shoulder. The patch itself is a blue-grey circle
containing 13 white stars, circumscribing a gold Republic insignia and a
white brooding wraith. Underneath, you can discern the words "Ghost
Squadron," along with a motto of some sort on a smaller, rectangular patch
sewn under the round one. On it is written 4 simple, yet strangely
powerful words: "To the very end". Her name tag identifies her as Colonel
Altair Quila, CO-Ghost Squadron.

Bazil's Description:
        This man's overall appearance is that of a typical, yet boring
one. His complexion is tan and slightly worn, signs of wear drifting from
place to place. His height is, once again, average; assumed around five
foot nine or ten. His yellow-brown eyes blend in with his brows and the
mop of frazzled short hair atop his head. His face is clean shaven, with
little sign of any hair growing thusly.
        His clothing suggests a civilian; a simple light green tunic under
a loose fitting deep grey coat. A simple band of gold chain is tucked into
the tunic, the end, hidden from view. Tucked, mostly hidden from view,
into the left pocket of the dark coat, is a small datapad, turned off,
with only a single corner revealing it's existance. His loose black
slacks, almost canvas in texture, give little notice of anything in
particular, with little to conceal underneath. Black leather boots cover
the remainer of his body, coming up to his thighs, and laced tightly.

Auxiliary Bay -- NRSC Deliverance
        This portion of the bay has been specifically designed to house,
launch and maintain the four squadrons of fightercraft assigned to the
Deliverance. The central section is wide open with a high arched ceiling
to allow some fighters to be moved to the upper 'storage' areas on either
side of the main landing bay. To one end of the hangar is the hazy blue
magnetic shield which separates the vacuum of space from the
atmospherically safe interior of the ship. Halfway up the inner wall is
the 'Flight Control Room', from where the flight control operators oversee
the activity below. This brightly lighted bay is organically colored in
deep grays, whites and greens, much like the rest of the ship.
        Starfighter technicians and utility droids are scattered
throughout the hangar area. Astromech droids are in abundance, following
their pilots or doing other tasks for the fighter they're assigned to.
Many of the pilots are also in evidence, some congregating near the muster
room while others work on their ships alongside the techs.

 &lt;S>tarboard leads to Hangar Bay -- NRSC Deliverance.

The bay, in it's usual daily hubbub, especially with the latest
preparations for the Death Star threat, is marked by the presence of an
extra Lambda shuttle, parked over near the Ghost Squadron X's. She is
powered down, for the moment, and a pair of humans stand outside her
entrance, talking it up. One, a pilot, shown obvious by his clothing and
whatnot, and the other, a civilian-clad man, trussed in the very clothes
he had worn the day he left the cruiser nearly a month ago. A stow bag
slung over his shoulder, the pair talk amongst themselves, in the midst of
the chaotic mess that is the auxiliary bay.

Altair wanders into the hangar bay, looking rather sheepish. She glances
around and, seeing no techs obviously out looking for her, the pilot seems
to relax somewhat and make her way over towards the line of X-wings. She
pauses as she grows nearer to them, noticing an new arrival into the bay.
That Lambda hadn't been there the other day. Curious, she changes her path
and meanders towards the ship, trying not to look too lookie-loo.

The civilian clad man's back is turned, at the moment, towards Altair,
though one that had served with him for so long might very well recognize
him, minus the green pokey hair that highlighted his head just a week ago.
Of course, Bazil had always worn his civilian clothing around the ship. He
despised uniforms, loathed them, to the point that he just gave up,
wearing his civvies more often than his normal duty clothes. As the pilot
and civilian talk it up, Bazil chuckles, and extends his hand towards the
pilot, parting his presence with a simple, "Cya 'round... and thanks." The
voice is just loud enough to be heard by anyone within earshot, and just
as recognizable as a once starfighterpilot, and XO of Ghost Squadron.

Altair gets a bit closer, cocking her head to one side as the man in
civilian dress is somehow familiar to her. As she gets within earshot, she
suddenly realizes that this is the fellow she met in the swoop arena the
other day. Not wanting to say "Bazil!" just in case he was still
undercover or something (even though it would be massively lame to
infiltrate a ship where everyone knows you) she simply approaches him and
stands in a place near the Valiant, peering at him curiously.

The shuttle pilot turns and steps back inside the Valiant, just as Bazil
turns, to face Altair, his turning abruptly halted from the woman, "Hey
there, Quila. How ya been?" He grins, and steps forward a little ways
towards her. It is, most definately, Bazil McKenzie, no doubts about that.
"You want your old XO back?" he inquires, a lopsided smile on his face. He
raises a hand to shift at the stow bag, which, as luck would have it,
presses deeply into his shoulder, giving evidence to something quite heavy
inside.

A smirk comes onto Altair's face as she realizes that Vauki is being Bazil
today. "Still haven't found a decent replacement,"  she says, eyeing the
bag curiously. "And new recruits keep pouring in, all eager and stuff. I
have no one to fend them off.  Horrors!" She smiles playfully, letting her
shoulder lean against the hull of the Lambda. "What's in the bag? Did you
bring presents from your mysterious absense?"

"New recruits... eesh. Just what I always wanted to come back to," Bazil
offers a small wink, before continuing on to the other subject, "Not
exactly... just some stuff the half-wits in Intel decided to drag from my
quarters here... weapons, datapads, clothes..." He shrugs, and continues,
"Plus a few things I picked up during my wonderful all-expense paid trip
to Coruscant." The last comment just /happens/ to by snide, and very
unappreciative. Being 'detained for plotting the death of a prisoner' must
not have been all that exciting, after all...

Altair arches a brow. "Yes, Coruscant," she says, narrowing her eyes and
peering at her former XO. "That sure is far from Corellia. Yup," she says
vaguely, her eyes drifting towards the ceiling. "Lalala," she says, trying
to sound all nonchalant.

The mysterious Bazil smirks, and playfully pokes at Altair's shoulder
softly, "Speaking of Corellia, you wanna go have a late lunch down on
Coruscant? Talk about how you beat everyone else at the swoop races, and
narrowly avoided catching a bug from the nasty Tatooine circuit?" He
winks, carefully masking his true intentions through a facade of idle
chitchat, that, to the casual listener, would seem normal, and definately
not out of the ordinary. No, Bazil hasn't been doing anything secret for
the past month. Not at all.

Altair shrugs, realizing that she is vaguely hungry and could probably go
for a nice lunch anyway. "Okay," she says, trying to appear equally casual
and glancing about suspiciously and not at all covertly. "Swoop racing.
Yes," she says, feeling as if she were suddenly in on a big secret.

A chuckle eminates from Bazil, and he tweaks at her again, "Hey, lighten'
up. Not like anyone's going to kill you for talking to an acquitted felon,
eh?" He winks, and makes motions to usher her towards the Valiant, "C'mon.
I'll get the pilot of her to give us a ride down to the planet's surface.

White Knight VIP Nightclub
--- Second Floor: Dining_Area --------------------------------------------------
 The Anti-Grav tube brings you to a small receiving area of the second
floor, which flows into the main dining area of the White Knight. Stepping
into the same aura as the rooms below, the balcony dining room is
decorated with similar designs as the lounge, the carpet being a very thin
but textured azure. Giving the rooms it's signature layout, the balcony
that surrounds the dance floor below has several dining tables of various
sizes, only a transparisteel railing surrounding the drop-off.
        Separated by the main dining area is the VIP Dining room, neon
fixtures and designs lining the wall that blocks the members-only area
off. Double transparent doors combined with two large security men form
the only entrance to the place. The anti-gravity tube that you arrived
from offers either a choice to the third floor of the club, or back down
to the lounge respectively.

As the pair step up into the dining area, a Sarian greeter come up to
them, greeting them with a pair of menus. "Table for two?" he inquires, as
Bazil nods him on. The Waiter offers a half bow, and leads the pair to a
secluded table away from most of the noise and glitz of the rest of the
club. Bazil moves over to a seat, and pulls it out for Altair, beckoning
her to sit.

Altair takes the turbolift up to the second floor and steps out into the
large restaurant that makes up the dining floor. She silently follows the
waiter and Bazil as they walk towards their table, just looking around and
taking in the snazzy decor.  "Snazzy," she says as she takes the seat
offered to her by the waiter. Taking the menu, she opens it up and peruses
the pricey list.

"Yeah... one of the fanciest on Coruscant, or so I've heard... only been
here a couple times." Now, why would someone who was arrested on charges
of murder be going to the fanciest nightclub on Coruscant? Bazil takes his
own seat, scooting into the table. He peers over the menu quietly for a
moment, before setting it down, already having decided on what he's to
order. He peers over Altair slowly, "It's so good to see you again,
Colonel... I'm sorry our previous encounter was so brief. I can't tell you
much more than... well... I've not exactly been doing what you were told
happened to me." And, thus, the truth comes out... sort of. He obviously
doesn't seem /too/ concerned to be revealing these little trinkets to her,
or to be doing it in a public joint like Knight.

Altair opens her menu and looks over it carefully. "I've never been her
before," she says. "I missed all the parties that the NR has sponsored
here. So this is my first time. I feel kind of silly in my grubby old
flight suit." With an impish grin, she tries to wipe off some of the
grease from her suit. "If I had known we were going to come someplace all
nice like this... Oh well." Looking up from her menu, she says, "You mean
you weren't in prison these last few months here on Coruscant?" she asks,
a hint of mock surprise in her voice. Of course he wasn't.

"Of course not. The Republic isn't /that/ harsh anymore. They gave me a
nice little apartment, and everything." He smiles, and shrugs her clothing
off. Bazil /is/ wearing, afterall, grubby and well worn civilian clothes,
"They aren't too harsh about dress code during the day. Otherwise, I would
have taken ya somewhere else."

Altair nods and grins, apparently satisfied with the clothing excuse.
Glancing back over her menu, she makes a decision and sets it, closed,
back on the table. She absentmindedly fiddles with the silverware lying on
the table and pokes at the intricately folded napkin sitting upon her
plate. "I always wondered how to fold these things like this," she ponders
aimlessly. "So what were you doing?" she asks, dropping her voice
slightly.

Bazil slowly leans over the table just a fraction, enough to be noticed by
those near enough. Hushing his voice, he responds, "I can't say /too/
much... other than Imperial. And, that I've been at this for quite some
time now..." He shrugs, folding his hands upon the table. His face is the
same, the hair nearly unchanged... the only real differences are a few
tiny scars that dot here and there on his face. Or were they there before?

Altair arches her eyebrows curiously, wondering just what he had done
regarding the Imperials. More likely than not it had something to do with
that Death Star that was floating around in space somewhere. "Ohh," she
says, nodding knowingly. A mischevious smile creeps onto her face, as if
she had a secret. Well, she did have a secret now. Bazil's secret. "Quite
an interesting vacation I'm sure," she says. "How long have you been at
it? Since you were working for diplo? Before?"

"Oh, I don't know anymore... a couple weeks after my Diplo job, I think."
Bazil leans back a little, pondering, "Oh, that's right... the last awards
ceremony down at the marching grounds. When you kept acting funny in front
of everyone." He grins softly, offering a small wink. Most definately, the
pilot-turned-who-knows-what isn't terribly concerned about anyone around
him hearing him speak. At what might be considered perfect timing, the
Sarian waiter returns, his eyes glancing over the pair's clothing
momentarily, before inquiring, "What can I get you two?" Bazil offers,
first, "A bottle of your finest Corellian Whiskey... pre-Endor, if you
have it. Also, I'll have the tark-fish filet." He peers to Altair
solemnly, as the waiter gawks at Bazil, "Sir... the Corellian Whiskey is
/quite/ expensive... we normally don't--" Bazil cuts him off, "I know
that. I can pay." His gaze remains fixed on Altair the entire him. There's
something there in his eyes... something he can't control. For those that
know him, they'd know it the same as when he tells certain stages of his
IGNews life story... those involving a certain Casey Johnson.

Altair blushes slightly at the mention of her performance at the awards
ceremony. "Yeah, that was quite a show," she mutters into her plate. "A
perfectly good explanation for that." Just as she is about to launch into
her explanation, the waiter arrives. She shifts uncomfortably as Bazil
starts to order some very expensive items. "I hope the NR is paying for
that," she comments, eyeing the pricelist of whiskey on the back of the
menu idly. As the waiter asks her what she wants, she says, "Can I just
get a plain nerfburger? Just the meat and the bread? With fries?" The
waiter marks down her order and nods smartly.

"Nice thing about my new line of work... is the pay. Of course, I managed
to pick up some winnings at the Swoop races last weekend." Bazil yet again
shrugs, the smile not faltering for a second. He is also, in some ways, a
lot different from the boyish little fighter jock he used to be. At least,
right now, anyways. Is it just for show? There's not really any way to
tell... "You were saying, about the explanation? I never did get a chance
to find out what happened with all of that..."

"Oh, right," Altair says, turning a little redder. "Well, um, you know
when I was in Imperial custody? Back after the swoop races on Selene?
Well, I have a feeling that a couple of Sith used me for training or
something. I remember them coming in.  And I remember one telling the
other how to make me do stuff. And then they left. There's kind of a gap
in there, but Luke found some remnants of their meddling and cleaned me
out. It's now safe to say "Fleet" around me with no jawa-esque
consequences."

Bazil nods softly, taking in the knowledge slowly. His smile dips, just
the slightest amount, "Think they set you up to respond to fleet, on
purpose? Or just as a joke?" He leans over the table slightly, picking up
his fork to toy with it slightly, spinning it ever so slowly in circles,
the lights from the club reflecting off upon the surrounding table.

"I think it was just a word they thought might come up often in my line of
work and that it would be funny to have me scuttle around like a Jawa.
They had me barking like a Nek Battle Dog whenever I heard the name Luke
Skywalker too." Altair pauses.  "I hadn't really thought that it might
mean something...Do you think it could?" she asks, suddenly feeling rather
concerned.

Nek Battle Dogs? Sith? Luke Skywalker? Ideas begin formulating in Bazil's
mind carefully... constructed with the base mechanics of knowledge. The
Angry Rancor... Morganna had been on that ship... so had several Nek's...
and Luke, for that matter. Right before Gastus. Could it be, in some
disturbing way, that the Sith decided to pull that prank on Altair here,
as a message, or some sort of inside jokes? Images flash into his mind of
pictures captured just recently from Corellia... intel had met up with the
new owner of the Angry Rancor, and he had a Nek by his side. 'Is there
something there? Or am I just being paranoid again?' Bazil thinks to
himself, a look of pondering on his face, the smile having disappeared,
and replaced by heavily creased brow lines. "I... don't know. It's
possible." Come the words, as he ponders diligently.

Altair cocks her head to one side. "Yeah?" she asks, trying to puzzle
together a link between the battle dogs and Luke. But nothing comes to her
head. Then again, she was not exactly a super sekrit intel agent either.
This is probably good, given her powers of deduction. "I wonder if Luke
would be able to tell," she ponders aloud.

"You might try getting in contact with him, Altie... he might be able to
help you unwravel this mess." He shrugs, smiling agian, "Who knows. You
might have the plans for the Death Star inside of that cute little noggin
of yours." Ok, so Bazil didn't mean for the word 'cute' to come out like
that, but it did, and it's out... somewhat. He tries his damndest to keep
his face the same, fighting back a wince. Luckily, yet again, fate
intervenes, and the waiter saunters back over to the table, setting down a
pair of holding struts, and a large round tray. Upon it, are a pair of
glasses, a bottle of expensive whiskey, a filet of some sort of meat, with
some fancy side-dishes, and a plain old nerf-burger, complete with fries.
The waiter dishes the food out, pouring the pair a glass of whiskey each,
leaving the bottle in the center of the table, before inquiring, "Will the
be anything else?" Bazil peers up from his dish, and shakes his head at
the man.

Altair doesn't notice the wince from Bazil, as the approaching food was
much more interesting. As the waiter arrives and sets the tray down, she
cranes her neck to get a glance at the presentation of the nerfburger on
the plate. She had had nerfburgers from hundreds of different restaurants
and it was always interesting to see how they presented it to the
customer. This particular nerfburger was quite nice. There was a colorful
sprig of some green little plant and a colored toothpick poking out of the
burger bun. The french fries were thick and juicy. "Looks good," the pilot
reassures the waiter as he sets it in front of her.

Despite the audible differences between the foods, they /seem/ to be as
nice as each other. The waiter bows again, and heads off, tray and stand
in hand. Bazil takes his attention to the whiskey, first, taking it up,
swirling the cool brown liquid around in it's glass slowly, watching it's
every move, and how it reacts to the glassware. He nods approvingly, and
takes a sip, letting the soft, yet burning, liquid slide it's way down,
"Good stuff." Once again, he peers at Altair, taking the napkin from
before him, and carefully sliding it upon his lap, with the utmost
mannerisms. Damned Diplo Corps, anyways. See what they did? No matter,
though, and Bazil takes up his silverware, slowly beginning to cut away at
his meat. /Definately/ not the unrefined, uneducated pilot from before.

Altair looks doubtfully at the small glass of whiskey in front of her.
Experimentally, she reaches out and picks it up, like Bazil does. She
swishes it around and sniffs it, like Bazil does. Then, instead of taking
a big sip, she sets it down on the table..for later. She then picks up the
burger and chows on it. Definitely a pilot. Not a diplomat.

"So, what has everyone been up to since I was gone? Anybody miss me?"
Bazil inquires quietly, as he plows a few hunks of the meat into his
mouth, and chews. He rests his wrists on the edge of the table, peering at
Altair again. That look from before returns, to some degree... he seems to
be thinking softly, as he peers, awaiting an answer to his question.

Altair looks at Bazil rather distressedly, as she has just taken a huge
bite of her hamburger and is in the midst of chewing it when he stops
talking and starts staring at her. "We've been tryng," she chokes around
her mouthful of food, "to mape a plan to appact the Ips." With a big
swallow, she sets her burger down and continues. "I think we set up a
little attack fleet to do quick hit and runs."

Bazil nods simply, swallowing down his own hunks of meat, pulling up a
thin stalk of some green vegetable. He places the end of it in his mouth,
gnawing on it slowly, before questioning again, "That's good... hopefully
I'll be able to stick around for a bit and help everyone along..." The
words are, most definately, true. His new job puts him in the unfortunate
position of being called upon whenever HQ deems fit, and throwing him into
missions more dangerous than fighting an entire squadron of TIEs by one's
self.

Altair smiles. "Good. Maybe you could help train some of these new cadets.
They're kind of eager for flight time and I can't take time to take out
each of them." After choking down that big bite of meat, she reaches out
and grabs what she thinks is a glass of water, but what is really her
glass of Whiskey. Gulping it down without a thought, she suddenly finds
that it is indeed, not water. "Gaaah!" she says, not expecting the burn.
"Hot hot!"

Bazil's go wide quite rapidly, as he reaches for the glass pitcher of
water, rapidly pouring some water into another empty glass, his moves
quick, calculated, and calm. After pouring, he slides off the seat
slightly, holding the glass out for her.  The pair seem to attract a bit
of attention from others around, as well, several stares from elderly
couples pointed in their direction.

Altair opens and closes her mouth several times, quite dismayed at the
pain sweeping down her esophogus. Corellian whiskey was not made to be
gulped. Sipped, yes. Gulped, no. She reaches for the water and pours it
down her throat, turning quite red from a combination fo the stares and
the liquor itself. "Woo," she exhales as she finishes the water. "That's
strong stuff!"

A simple grin eminates from Bazil's mouth as he nods, "Yep. Definately is.
You alright?" He peers at her compassionately, absent-mindedly pouring a
glass of water for himself. Setting the jug down with a small _tink_ he
pulls the glass of water up to his lips, taking a drink of the
less-viscous liquid, and then sets it down, slowly getting on with his
meal. The stares around die down for the most part, all of the other
patrons going back to their own business.

Altair nods, hesistant to speak as the burning has yet to completely fades
away. She, too picks up her burger and takes another bite, though
noticeably smaller than the one she took the last time Bazil asked her a
question. She had learned her lesson. "So I guess you can't really talk
about what you've been up to, huh? And I should keep my mouth shut about
it, right?"

Bazil nods solemnly, munching on his food, thinking to himself as he
stares off into space. Finally, he swallows, and offers, "Yeah... I'd like
to tell you. Make for a helluva story. But I can't... need-to-know, you
know?" His attention remains unfocused for several more moments, before he
shrugs, and looks up to Altair's face, the eyes studying it slowly. He
smiles, replacing the dull expression from seconds before. That look
again, but only for a brief flicker of a second, before he continues on
with his meal slowly, prodding at some strange yellow side-dish 'mush'
with his fork as he chews.

Altair nods solemnly. "Secrets are no fun sometimes," she concludes,
taking a few french fries from her plate. Looking furtively about, she
drops her voice and leans forward. Just as she is about to speak, that
waiter shows up again, interrupting her. "Are you finding everything
satisfactorily?" he asks properly, holding a stack of menus folded in his
arm.

"Quite." Bazil offers, his eyes glancing up towards the waiter, before
adding, "Might you bring the check, so we aren't held up after we're
finished?" The waiter nods, simply slipping a hand into the pouch around
his waist, drawing forth a thin datapad, and dropping it carefully on the
table. The waiter, quite pleased to be done with the pair of 'miscreants,'
wanders off to serve others. Bazil peers up to Altair, offering her yet
another smile, before starting on the strange side-dishes. As he swallows
the strange concoctions, he waggles his brows, pulling up the whiskey to
take a small draw, and offers, "That's... different."

Altair looks uneasily at the check as the waiter places it on the table.
She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a handful of credits. "Let me
chip in. I made a little something at the swoop races too. This is going
to be expensive." She plunks the credits down on the table and starts
counting them. But she is distracted by the comment about his mushy side
dishes. "What is it?" she asks, craning her neck to see the food better.

"Oh, no, I'll get it... I can just transfer money from my account... it
ought to be easier than leaving a pile of credits for that poor kid..."
Bazil offers quietly, after quickly swallowing to let his words out. "It's
some sort of... I don't know...  it's... yeah. It's salty, sweet, and
everything else in between." He shrugs, sliding a small datachit from,
well, his sleeve, and placing it down in front of him. Some sort of rather
common bank account ID card, or something.

Altair looks uneasily at Bazil, not feeling entirely comfortable with
being paid for. At least she hadn't ordered the more expensive steak she
had her eye on. "Ookay," she says reluctantly as he slides his ID onto the
table. "If you insist." Far be it from her to argue with a free meal.
Especially when said free meal was not from the Deliverance's mess hall.

Nodding slightly, Bazil smiles at Altair again, pulling the datapad and
his chit up, sliding the little piece into the datapad, tapping in a few
commands, and then removing the little guy, slipping it back into whatever
concealed place it came from. He lets the datapad back onto the table
before pushing his nearly-empty plate away. "That was good... how was
yours?"  he inquires, quietly, pulling his glass up to take another draw,
his eyes fixeated on the slightly-younger woman.

Altair seems, somehow, nearly oblivious to the admiring of her former XO.
When she catches him staring at her with that look in his eyes, she cocks
her head to one side and grins goofily, wondering what it is that he is
looking at like that. "It was good," she replies. "One of hte best
nerfburgers I've had in a long time. Thanks for covering the bill." She
pulls the unfolded napkin out of her lap and sets it on the table and
promptly begins to try and fold it into its original shape.

Bazil's own napkin is taken up, and quite messily plodded down onto an
empty space on the table. "No problem," he offers, in response to the
bill, and he stretches slightly, grinning in return at the goofy look with
humor. He likes her, that's for sure... but, he's very unsure of himself.
He had himself in this position once before, that's for certain... and
look how /that/ ended...

Altair folds and folds the napkin this way and that until she ends up with
a very plain looking box. Nothing like the elaborate swanlike napkins that
had graced the table when they had arrived. "Bah," she says, laying her
square thing down on the table. "I don't get it." She shakes her head in
frustration, but does not look genuinely upset in any way. "Perhaps I will
buy a book on napkin folding someday," she teases.

A boyish chuckle escapes Bazil's mouth, a wide grin playing over his face,
"Do you think they make such books?" He takes another draw of the brown
near-toxic liquid.

Altair shrugs slightly. "Dunno. The people have to learn somewhere. And a
book seems like a good a place as any. A whole class on napkin folding
seems superfluous. And that someone could make them up seems coincidental.
A lot of places use the same designs, you know." She speaks as fi she has
been paying great attention to the napkin designs around town.

He certainly seems to be enjoying the conversation, that's for sure. But
unfortunately, Bazil's glass begs to differ, as he draws the final drink
from it. He frets momentarily, before shrugging it off, "Don't wanna get
drunk today. Still got to get back to the Del... you wanna stick around
Coruscant for a bit longer, or what?" While he talks, he makes motions to
get ready to leave, corking the bottle of whiskey, and pulling it back
towards himself.

Altair looks at her half empty glass of whiskey. The unfortunate gulp
earlier had done in a good deal of it. She takes a quick sip of what
remains, leaving a little bit left in the glass before pushing her chair
away from the table and standing up. "Up to you. You're the pilot on this
one. I've got a few things to take care of back on the Del. But then..I'm
not sure that I really want to admit to Johanna that I pulled off an
adjucator valve off the wing of my X-wing. She's going to kill me."

Bazil chuckles in response to the comment, nodding as he stands, "You
certainly do have a knack for getting on techie's nerves, don't you,
Altair?" He pulls up the bottle of whiskey, sliding it under his arm, and
crosses around the table to Altair, offering his elbow to her, all
gentlemanly like. "Doesn't matter to me... we could take a shuttle about
the city for a little bit, or head back up... see if we can elude Johanna
for a bit?" He winks, smiling in humor.

Altair smiles sheepishly. "I guess I do have a knack. Maybe I'm gifted."
A tech irritating genius Altair was probably not.  But she flew
starfighters pretty well. She reaches out and loops her arm in his and is
properly escorted away from the table and out of the restaurant. "We can
tool around for a bit. It's early yet.

Menrai Mountain Base -- Imperial City

        The base of the mountain appears to be a prime tourist
attraction, yet many residents of the planet visit here often to remind
themselves that this world was once very much a thriving ecological
planet. A grand bazaar begins here at the base of the mountain and
stretches for nearly a kilometer to the west. As the day wanes, much of
the bazaar moves from the shadow of the mountain into the sunlight, then
falls under the shadow of the grand palace as the sun sets.
        A handful of New Republic soldiers patrol this area of the city,
more of a reassurance to the populace than for actual security. Private
security officers control access to the TRAM station, and ultimately to
the mountain peak above. To the north and west are the luxurious homes of
Coruscant's elite citizens, each with a large panoramic view of the
mountain.

As the shuttle taxi bearing the pair circles the tourist hotspot near the
tram station, Bazil peers at the window, seated just a few inches from
Altair in the back of the vehicle. He smiles, and peers out over the
mountain, marvelling over it, "Amazing, that something like that could
thrive in the midst of such a city."

Altair peers out the window of the hovertaxi as Menrai mountain looms
into view. "Yeah," she agrees as the car pulls up at the taxi stop
outside of the tram station. The pilot is quick this time to pass the
driver a few credit chips before Bazil can manage it. "Thanks," she says
to the driver as she pulls open the door. "I haven't taken a tram ride in
forever," she says excitedly as she emerges out into the open air and hte
crowded sidewalk.

Bazil smiles, letting Altair pass on the credits -- this time -- without
argument. He follows her, ducking out of the taxi, and nodding, "Me,
either... I can't even remember when I've been on one last. Corellia, I
think..." He again offers his elbow for her; whether as affection,
manners, or simply so he doesn't lose her in the crowds is uncertain.

Altair takes his arm and takes off through the crowds, nearly dragging
him along with her. It's a good thing he offered it or he may very well
have lost her in the crowds. "Where is there a tram on Corellia?" she
asks as she walks along. "Up to some mountain somewhere? I remember
taking a ride when I was really young. I don't remember where. It was
really bizarre because it was all hot at the bottom fo the mountain. At
at the top there was snow. I had never been in snow before."

"Snow?" Bazil boggles at the woman, waggling his eyebrows in utter
confusion, "What's that?" As they reach the tram office, he slides a few
credits to the eldery woman manning the station, who passes back a pair
of tickets with a friendly, "Have fun!"

Altair furrows her brow. "You've never heard of snow?" she asks
increduously, nearly coming to a complete stop and staring at him dumbly.
"Grief! Where are you from? It's like...rain..but solid and colder.
You'll have to go to Caspar some winter. It snows there a lot." She lets
him get the tickets, since he beat her to it with the credits and then
heads towards the air tram.

Fretting quietly to himself, Bazil seems near-embarrassed at the
unfortunate lack of his knowledge of this strange type of precipitation,
"I've only been to Caspar during the spring and summer seasons... I guess
I'll have to go there then." He falters for a moment, before responding
again, his course headed towards the airtram, "I was born and raised in
the Tatooine system... a slave..." The words are deprecated, and he
glances to the ground solemnly.

This time Altair really does come to a full stop. But only for a moment,
lest she embarass Bazil. "Really? A slave?" she asks resuming her walk at
a much slower pace. "I guess you wouldn't know what snow was then, huh?
With any luck there'll be some up on the peak, but I doubt it at this
time of the year."

Bazil mentally panics, but only for a split second... he has revealed
this story to others before. Maybe it's just being in public that's
making him this way... maybe. The pair finally come to stop at the rather
short line heading into the tram, the tickets in Bazil's hand flicking
softly with his fingers, "Yeah... I... my father was the owner of a small
mining colony on a Tatooinian asteroid... lived there for sixteen years
before I--" he falters, the painful memories resurfacing yet again. He
had hoped he wouldn't have to think of this for a long time, but it's too
late now. With a sigh, he continues, "I left, to put it in mild terms...
I... did away with my father, and left my past behind me." His eyes,
which have thus far been staring at the ground beneath him, pull up to
peer into Altair's face, the globes of brown light flickering back and
forth to admire, study, and comprehend the woman.

As they near the line, Altair has no choice but to stand still and
listen, almost painfully, to Bazil's story. "I'm sorry, Baz," she says as
his eyes rise to meet hers. "I didn't know. I wouldn't have asked like
this if I knew.." Well, that was a silly thing to say. Of course no one
would have asked if they had known. She stands awkwardly for a moment,
searching for something to say that won't sound lame or like she's
changing the subject. Coming to her rescue is the front of the line. The
ticket taker takes their tickets and directs them towards the entrance of
the tram where they will be boarding.
