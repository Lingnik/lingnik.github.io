Players Involved: Altair, Lianna, Bazil, Wedge, Vek

==LOG BEGINS==

Lianna turnsto look at Avitar as he interrupt her conversation ith the
Quartermaster, then glances at the olde man shrug, and she sighs. "No
problem", she says, letting him go. This isn't certainly her month.
Turning she shoots a few daggers at Avitar's back and then glances at
Wedge, rolling her eyes.

Altair strides casually out of the Muster Room into the hangar bay, her
flight helmet under her arm. Ghost One is already away from the line of
parked X-wings and has techs scrambling around it, getting ready for it to
launch. As she walks into the larger hangar bay, she looks around for a
couple pilots who look bored and shiftless. "Anyone up for some fighting?"
she asks loudly to the hangar bay at large. She pulls a pair of gloves out
of a pocket in her flight suit and begins to slip them onto her hands.

With long, drawn out strides, Bazil makes the corner from the rest of the
hangar, and into the aux bay. Decked out for the first time in a long
time, he struts his stuff, his jumpsuit pristine and perfect, donning
several more silver rank bars than the last time. As he passes amidst the
various foot-traffic in the bay, he glances about, his eyes finally
landing on Altair.  Smiling lightly to himself, he makes his way directly
towards her, and offers up, "Sure thing, Colonel." His decision to
surprise her couldn't come at a better time, it seems, as she too is up
for some action. Hopefully, Bazil can keep his record clean of too much
dirt in the air.

Lianna turns to look at the small gathering of pilots, stopping her gaze
at Bazil and Altair for a moment, before she shakes her head. "Looks like
this will get buisy.", she says to noone in particular, just makes sure to
step away from the quartermaster and supervise the preflights on the
fighters.

"Looks like a small change of plans, Cadet," Wedge says to Vek out of the
corner of his mouth upon hearing Altair's request. He makes his way toward
Altair. "You have a couple of willing pilots here, Colonel. We can see
what this cadet is made of." He winks and thumbs toward Vek. Seeing Bazil
come into view and also accepting the challenge, he says "Perhaps we could
break into teams? I'll take Eldar here."

"I'm game, Colonel," Vek adds with a confident grin. The Commander had
just volunteered to have Vek fly his wing and a bit of a stupefied look
crossed his face. "Don't get me wrong, sir, but are you sure that's a good
idea?"

"Bazil! You're in uniform!" the Colonel chirps as she sees him all decked
out in his flight suit. That was unusual. "You wanna get some flight time
in?" Altair tosses a glance to Lianna. "Is it okay if we go bang up the
fighters a little? Some of the cadets are kind of green. I promise not to
blow them up entirely. Just knock 'em down a notch or two. Your techs need
something to do anyway, right?" she asks with a wink. The pilot bounces
back and forth on her toes, her adrenaline beginning to work.

"Of course I'd like to. I managed to convince them to let me to on-duty a
couple days early." Bazil grins, and shrugs, beginning to stretch at his
limbs. It has been a while since he flew one of those things.

Lianna looks at Altair, then at the Cadet present. She hesitates for a
moment, before she nods. "I'll let the capcitators be tuned down. Less
damage but more realistic then the tagreting lazer, Colonel.", she says,
not really smiling or laughing at her joke how unoccupied she things the
techies are right now.
