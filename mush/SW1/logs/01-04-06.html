<h1>BazLogs: 01-04-06</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>Bazil, now without helmet on, let alone armor on his arms, works at waking Karrde now. Mostly by slapping him in his face, and whatnot, and pouring water on him. Wedge, meanwhile, pilots the vessel to safety. Hopefully.</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Grassius_Knoll on SF-7266 rolls a 26 for his STARSHIP PILOTING skill.  An Excellent roll!</p>
<p>Karrde wakes up in a bad mood, groggy, and instantly panicked. There's a moment of struggle before he glares at Grassius.</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Ceboran's firing at the Flippant Dawn is, in fact, missing.</p>
<p>Bazil grins, and pokes at Karrde's shoulder, "Quit that, Karrde. It's me. Bazil." And he offers his trademark smirk. Boy, this probably wasn't the face he was expecting to wake up to. The ship shudders slightly.</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Dieter on SF-5307 rolls a 14 for his STARSHIP GUNNERY skill.  An Average roll!</p>
<p>"What the..." Karrde keeps his glare, looking quickly around. "Are we being -shot- at?" He's like this in the morning, too.</p>
<p>"Umm. Yeah. By the Griffons... what I take to be the Covenant... and a few other folks," Bazil offers, "I don't think they like me anymore."</p>
<p>Karrde bites back something in response, gathering his wits. He catches sight of Wedge, then looks back to Bazil. "I take it the explanation comes later," he remarks dryly.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-6149: "We will be jumping to 247,263,482 momentarily. After that, we will be headed directly for another system, yet to be determined. We have reason to believe there is a Jedi in the service of Emperor Valak on our tail. Over."</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-5307 The Halo lets loose with more laser blasts towards the aft section of the Minion. With a little prayer they may hit.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7113 has just engaged its hyperdrive and entered hyperspace at 0,0,0.</p>
<p>"Let's just say it was Luke's idea, mmmkay?" Bazil offers, before motioining fore, "Your people want to talk to you."</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Grassius_Knoll on SF-7266 rolls a 18 for his STARSHIP PILOTING skill.  A Good roll!</p>
<p>Karrde grunts eloquently and struggles to his feet, brows knitted. He's not happy, but he appreciates a Situation. Getting to the communications, he scans briefly and radios.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-6176 over frequency 1312.70: " Ion Dove requestin permission to deoart the system over"</p>
<p>Bazil, meanwhile, takes his place in the copilot's seat, carefully plotting a jump.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-6149: "*sounding groggy* I'm not asking what in blazes is going on yet. Orson, are you there?"</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-4239 over frequency 1312.70: "You're cleared, take care of lasers."</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-5307 Lets loose with his laser cannons and barely misses the minion, the Halo then shifts its position, breaking high and away from the minion.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-7266 over frequency 1312.70: "Guys, would you prefer we just self destruct here, and get it over with? I mean, if you want Karrde dead, go ahead. Fire. Over."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-6149 -- "'This is Toby, Karrde. Orson is occupied at the moment, he says he's talking to an Imperial agent. A woman. We would like to know your final destination is, it would not be safe for us to follow you out.' He hesitates a moment, 'Are you alright?'"</p>
<p>Grumbling, Bazil takes a moment to explain, "Luke said he thought you'd be in too much danger if you went to Selene. So he had me kidnap you, under this guise. I'm sorry, but we can't let Cimber murder you."</p>
<p>Karrde glances briefly to Bazil, and keys the communications to somewhere else, taking a few steps back to speak from a distance.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4173 continues to fly, the ship moves smoothly through space and seems to be keeping up with the fleeing vessel. her weapons don't charge up, just yet.. no itchy trigger fingers here.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-7266 over frequency 1312.70: "*Karrde, sounding groggy and in the background* And... medical assistance."</p>
<p>Karrde grunts and shuffles back, rekeying to speak to his vessel.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-6149: "*assuringly* I'm alright, little out of it. It's been interesting. Imperial agent? *pause* Be careful, tell him that for me. Yes, follow."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-6149 -- "Toby's voice sounds strained, as if he's looking out at the battle and trying to juggle tasks. 'Orson has informed me that the Imperial is trying to track your exit vector. We will make a short false jump and meet with you later if you can transmit the coordinates.'"</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Flippant Minion continues on, her engines pushing her further from the station as she carefully dodges each and every shot. Some scathe her hull, leaving some carbon scoring. However, one thing is for certain. Whoever is piloting, they're good.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> CS-9713 What can only be described as a storm of lasers rains down in front of the yt-1300 trying to escape, not in an attempt to destroy the ship but to cause it to slow down or veer from it's present course. As suddenly as it started it stops and the TIE fighters swoop down and keep the Mantaray company forming up on it's wings.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-3572 has just landed at 829,-342,407. (SS-1138)</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-6149: "In that case, do not follow. Stay clear, I'll contact you when I'm able. Can you get word from Selektah to take command until then?"</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4239 has his weapons back loaded. and shoots full energy on the minion's hyperdrive.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SS-1138 over frequency 1312.70: "Yeah, kick SF-7266's ass."</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Gyzen_Bel on SF-4239 rolls a 19 for his STARSHIP GUNNERY skill.  A Good roll!</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Grassius_Knoll on SF-7266 rolls a 22 for his STARSHIP PILOTING skill.  An Excellent roll!</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-6149 -- "There is a brief flash of static. Toby reluctantly says, 'Alright. We'll get in contact with Selektah as soon as we can. Contact us soon.'"</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-6149: "I will. Maybe by then I'll have figured this mess out. Karrde out."</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-5307 just performed a focused scan on you.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From CS-9713 over frequency 1312.70: "Flipant Minion, this is the Starship Masquerade, cease your current course and come to a halt. You will not be harmed if you co-operate."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-6149 -- "Toby laughs briefly, talking to a someone on the bridge, 'And Orson challenged you to a Dejarik match.'"</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-7266 over frequency 1312.70: "Starship Masquerade, I cannot comply. Sorry. Over."</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Grassius_Knoll on SF-7266 rolls a 33 for his STARSHIP GUNNERY skill.  A Heroic roll!</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-6149: "*laughs* Right, I'll have to have more practice before I get to them. Then alright, I'll be in touch as soon as I'm able. Thank you."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-6149 -- "Affirmative. Good luck, Cap'n. This is Wild Karrde out."</p>
<p>Karrde gives Bazil a dour look and works his way back to the floor, rubbing his temples and saying nothing as he takes a seat.</p>
<p>"There's a refresher unit back there, and some food, if you're hungry," Bazil offers simply, frowning to himself. Damn Luke, anyways.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-6176 quickly fires her ion engines headin towards SF-7266, The ship powers up all weapons and shields while in route.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-5307 The Halo turns and makes a break towards the edge of the sector.</p>
<p>Karrde nods vaguely and murmurs, "Who's shooting at us, and why?"</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From SF-5307 over frequency 1312.70: "This is the Halo. Gentlemen, it's been fun, and frankly to those aboard the Minion, you shall all go straight to hell when we next meet."</p>
<p>"Oh, the Griffons, and what I take to be Covenant vessels. I think they're mad because we nearly destroyed their station getting you out of there," Bazil says simply.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-5307 has just engaged its hyperdrive and entered hyperspace at 200,200,200.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4239 suddenly stops as the engines go offline. Heck. An engine failure.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4239 is being picked up by an utility craft that just took off Pride-1 and is brought back to the navy hangar.</p>
<p>There's a soft groan from Karrde. "Faith is going to kill me... no, -Admiral CImber- is going to kill me... do you have any idea?"</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4239 has just landed at 829,-342,407. (SS-1138)</p>
<p>"The Admiral was probably going to kill you when you two had your meeting on Selene," Bazil explains.</p>
<p>There's a pause, and a quiet, "That was a risk." Karrde's not going to argue the theory.</p>
<p>"Tell that to Luke. I'm only doing what he wanted me to do. I don't think it'll much matter anymore, though, if Morganna tells the Empire who did it," Bazil offers, before letting out a sigh, "This whole thing was meant to keep your involvement with the NR secret."</p>
<p>Karrde spends a good few minutes silently rubbing his temples.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATIONS> From CS-9713 over frequency 3000.00: "Very well. Maquerade out."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Flippant Minion takes some flak to her aft hull, sending a communications dish flying behind, only to crash against a persuing vessel. As she continues on, her hyperdrives begin to warm up. Almost to the edge of Pride-1's gravity well, and then she only needs to get away from the pair of capital ships.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Karrde. I know this really farked some things up for you. But I, personally, don't want you dead," Bazil finally offers. "Neither does Luke," He adds, trying to make sure Karrde doesn't think he's in love with him, or likes him, or anything. No. That wouldn't be good.</p>
<p>Deep breath. "Well, I think I see what the logic was with this, though... I don't know, the meeting with the Admiral was a no win situation. Now I don't know what it is. Thank you for not wanting me dead, and for trying to help." Karrde sounds tired, but sincere.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-6176 quickly tries to dodge the dish from the Minion as the pilot gets a good lock on the fleeing dhip. Once in range the Ion Dove unloads a small aray of laser fire.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4173 veers away slightly from the Minion and begins to make an exit vector itself, the hyperdrives begin to warm up, as a course is plotted.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> CS-9713 just performed a focused scan on you.</p>
<p>"Karrde, we're not going to get away from that RAF. They're too big, and too maneuverable, for us to get out of their gravwell," Bazil offers lightly, leering out at the vessels.</p>
<p>Karrde looks up from his silent contemplation. "Options, or are you asking me for a plan?" he asks quietly.</p>
<p>"I'm not used to slow ships. I can't figure a way out of this. At all. I'm used to things that I can scream away from persuers... this thing... well. I'm at a loss. Any ideas?" Bazil inquires, leering behind quietly as Wedge works the controls.</p>
<p>Karrde gets up and makes his way over, bracing against the back of the seat as he squnts out at the ships. "Who's out there? Covenant? Griffon? Someone named Valen, he was on the station."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Minion, outpaced by the larger ship, can do nothing but continue to fly away, attempting to get away from the vessel behind, as she dodges smaller ships.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-6176 inches closer to Minion in hopes for a better shot..again the Ion Dove relaeses another small aray of lazer fire.</p>
<p>"The Griffons are out there. General Penta's prolly on the station. The Covenant. Yeah. Valen, something," Bazil offers from the seat, grumbling to himself, "Should have brought my assault shuttle." Tapping at the controls idly, he scans the RAF. "I wonder if Amadeus is out there..." He wistfully ponders to himself. The guy whose life he had to save. Freaky man.</p>
<p>Karrde shakes his head. "Find out where Valen is, I'll tightbeam something to him. He's the current leader."</p>
<p>Bazil moves to the controls, tapping away at sensor logs, whatnot, "Unless he's still on whatever ship he boarded, he's probably on their capship by now. That RAF out there. I don't know, really."</p>
<p>Karrde lets out a breath, and taps the com system again. "Which one's their flagship then, I'll ask for him."</p>
<p>"See es dash nine seven one three," Bazil states simply.</p>
<p>Karrde nods and keys in the settings to speak.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-9713: "This is Karrde, is Valen onboard?"</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-9713 -- "This is he."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-9713: "I'm awake and some idea of the situation... I can talk my way out of these beings' client, with a live bounty. I can't talk my way out of the blaster his friend has on me."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The TIE fighter in pursuit of the freighter turns suddenly and flanks the Masquerade like a good little puppy.</p>
<p>Karrde watches the ship scanner patiently.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from SF-6176 -- " and my i ask who has this bounty on your hostage?"</p>
<p>"Caspian and Independent civilians," Bazil bluntly says to Karrde.</p>
<p>"You took tax money for this?" Karrde asks rhetorically.</p>
<p>"There was no bounty," Bazil replies.</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> Radio transmission from CS-9713 -- "Very Well Mr Karrde, The Covenant will honor your decision. Masquerade out."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-9713: "Not too certain, but my people tell me my best weapon is my allies, and my second is my ability to talk my way out of messes. The first will get me killed now, allow me to deploy my second."</p>
<p>&lt;COMMUNICATION> You transmit to CS-9713: "Thank you."</p>
<p>&lt;SPACE> The Flippant Dawn finishes warming her hyperdrives up, engines pushing her along as fast as her nimble little body will go, as she heads away from her persuer.</p>
<p>Karrde keys the com off that ship and turns, running a hand through his hair and frowning. He says nothing.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> CS-9713 The massive ship slows slighly letting the freighter edge away from it, and it's grav-well.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Bazil offers simply.</p>
<p>"Why can't dealing with the Empire be that easy?" Karrde asks, again rhetorically.</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-4173 has just engaged its hyperdrive and entered hyperspace at 500,500,500.</p>
<p>&lt;NAVIGATION> Destination reached.      </p>
<p>Grassius_Knoll plots a jump in the Navcomputer.</p>
<p>&lt;JUMP> Route calculated and recorded as Jump Number 3. Estimated travel time:  5s</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-6176 continues pursute of the frighter firing randomly in hope to hit her engines</p>
<p>&lt;SENSORS> SF-7266 slips past the edge of the Masquerade's gravwell finally, letting off a solitary blast from her laser cannon, before jumping into hyperspace. To relative safety.</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Chipper on SF-6176 rolls a 10 for his STARSHIP GUNNERY skill.  A Poor roll!</p>
<p>&lt;Space> &lt;SKILL> Grassius_Knoll on SF-7266 rolls a 23 for his STARSHIP PILOTING skill.  An Excellent roll!</p>
<p>Grassius_Knoll engages the hyperdrive.</p>
<p>&lt;JUMP> Hyperdrive engaged.</p>
