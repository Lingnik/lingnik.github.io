This R2 unit is obviously very old as it is scuffed and scratched in many places even though the new cream and dark green paint job appears new. It's main reciptical is very large on it's dome head which itself it placed on a cylindrical body. The droid moves around on three legs with attached wheels and is devoid of any markings except for a Skull symbol on one leg with the word Lage under it, and the words 'Swoop Ghost' on the other leg.

Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor
The nexus and reception center of this luxurious ship is an open-space extravaganza, replete with plush seating and decor of impeccable taste and decadence. The lounge is large, a vault, and boasts a segmented glass ceiling that allows passengers to view the starscape while in transit. The ribs of the structure are articulated in pleasing curves with pewter moldings of creatures from all over the galaxy, like gargoyles at stress points.
        The stained oak-panelled walls harbor display cases for animals of various sizes and environments, each cage fitted with an informational plaque next to it. Tables are situated throughout the room and draped in red velvet tablecloths, many being dangerously close to the cages housing the exotic animals. A bar rests at the end of the vault, offering a variety of drinks, and gold droids move about frequently to refill the stray glass or empty plate. In one corner, tucked away behind lush foliage is a huge mahagany-panelled hot tub and sauna.
        All in all, an amazing space with amazing views and the ultimate in spacefaring comfort and enjoyment.

Bazil wanders in from the hangar, his mood a bit downturned from last night. A soft frown wrinkles his forehead, as he saunters on over to the bar casually, looking around every so often... for someone.

If anything, Luke is wary of the attention his public status gives him, and doesn't react in the same ways Lando does. Nonetheless, despite the calculated grace of his movements, the Jedi Master is more relaxed than he has been in months, and he smiles easily as he strolls in next to the renowned gambler. "What do you think, should we grab dinner while we're out here?" he asks Lando.

Gabrielle stands near the exhibit of a Croraitan sand tiger, reading the informational plaque with only half interest. Her mind was elsewhere, brows furrowed with the intense sign of deep thought. Her hand traces the raised lettering of the plaque briefly, a quiet sigh escaping her lips as she turns gold green eyes towards the exhibit before her, not truly seeing past the fram of the transparisteel. <Gabbie's pose Via Lando>

As the planet Gastus spins slowly outside the ceiling viewports, something large.. grey and perfectly round flickers into view against the blackness of space.. It is as if a moon suddenly appeared where there was none before.. A voice crackles over the intercom, just as the faint triangle shapes of Imperial Star Destroyers flicker out of hyperspace next to the enormous round object.. "Um.. ladies and gentlemen.. no need to be alarmed but.." the voice fades to static again.. The lighting in the lounge subtley changes to a darker hue.. "what the hel.." the voice can be heard over the com, "Um.. Yes. Passengers please hold on while we figure out just what that is." the voice breaks nervously then cuts out. The giant monstrosity and it's unholy escort slowly move toward the planet.

Bazil blinks, as he turns, the flickering of light just barely capturing his attention... he stares for several moments, trying to take in the view above him, and what exactly is going on.

Swarms of fighters roil out of the belly of the giant orb...

Gabrielle holds a bit against the lettered plate, looking up from her reverie, brow furrowing as she glances out the viewports, the words over the comm sinking in. "What the..." She says in reflection, eyes darting around the lounge filled with patrons.

Sam'viel arrives from Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Sam'viel has arrived.
R2-D1 turns his dome toward Sam'viel slowly, then slowly turns away again.
Sam'viel enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Lianna was just walking back into the Lounge from the Casino, heading for her room, but now stops, taking a look at the Planet, Gastus, below. a sight that makes her dread enough already, but the sight of Star Destroyers is actually not helping this feeling any.

A klaxon goes off blaring throughout the ship, "Crew to the bridge, immediately." the voice shouts. The faint rumble of engines shudders beneath everyone's feet.. The giant space station escorted by Star Destroyers continues on toward Gastus, while the swarm of fighters angle toward the Angry Rancor. "Now! There's a Dea.." the voice shrieks, then is cut off abruptly in the speaker's haste. In an oddly contrasted soothing tone, a female comes over the com instead, "Hello passengers. Please find a seat while we make an unprepared jump out of this system. The chef is offering.." in the background a male voice can be heard shouting, "..no time for the dinner menu! Tell them to hold on for.." the com clicks off.

"Yeah dinner sounds great." Calrissian says glancing at his friend and flashing one of those trademark smiles, "After all, can't play sabacc on an empty...." just as quickly as the Imperial Star Destroyers and that large, dark org appeared; so does his smile dissappear. He looks to his friend with a half quizzical, half worried look, "Luke...?"

Bazil shoots a glance towards Lianna, as she enters his frame of view. He offers a short glance to the ships above... especially the fighters, before turning his attention back to her, and setting out towards her at a moderately quickened pace, his hand hovering delicately over the blaster sidearm, "Hey, Techie, hold up..." He finally reaches her, peering up again to view the vehicles.

Talk about a sight to wake up to; Imperial Star Destroyers, fighters and a Dea? What is a Dea? Sam manages to get his first view out of viewport since he left his room. Ah, now that's something different. Sam just blinks slightly and moves over towards a point just outside the door of the Hotel. Shaking his head slightly, he leans against the wall. Hold on? He can do that. He grabs onto the nearest part of the wall possibly, calmly however, and just waits silently. He seems more surprised, maybe slightly horrified. But worried? Not really.

The fighters boiling out of the giant Death Star make chase toward the Angry Rancor. The ship moves ever faster away from the planet and it's attackers.. the space station and it's complement of Star Destroyers seem to be moving toward the planet and not giving chase to what seems to be the lone ship in the system. "Ladies and gentlebeings.. I've been instructed by the first officer to ask you to.. uh.. grab onto something. It looks like we may be under attack by Imperial TIE fighters.. they are closing in." the nervous female voice crackles to static.

Viewscreens pop to life around the ship.. showing readouts coming from the bridge.. <SENSORS> M-6633 The muzzle, located in a concave depression in the upper hemisphere of the battle station slowly rotates into a position that faces it against the quiet green world at the center of this otherwise silent system.

Altair has arrived.
Altair enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

To face attacking fighters in a Calamari cruiser is one thing. To face one in a liner like the Rancor...Lianna's line of thought is interrupted by Bazil, and she looks at him, frowning, although breifly. There isn't much she can do about it, can she?

Feylin arrives from Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Feylin has arrived.
Feylin enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

The moment the Death Star looms into view, Luke stands stock still and watches the viewport, feeling the engines surge to life beneath their feet. "This doesn't look good," he says, the understatement of the evening, wishing suddenly that he had his X-wing here as he watches the squadron of fighters heading for the ship. But there's nothing to be done, and he knows it. Then he glances at Lando and frowns.

"You know you take one day's worth of time for yourself..." Gabrielle mutters under her breath, the scene unfolding in the view port before her. She checks the firearm she has yet to remove from her holster at her hip. She'd been here all of what...two hours? Not much she can do with that now..the danger was outside. The question was exactly why the Imperials were deciding to attack a pleasure cruiser? The only thing she could do was hold on and wait...and from the sounds of the organization of the ship's crew, perhaps provide crowd control. Her eyes flicker over some familiar faces in the crowd around her.

"Ladies and gentlebeings.. we will be jumping out of this system as soon as the coordinates come up.." the female voice tries to soothe.. Faintly, as she clicks off the mic, she can be heard saying, "..Jack and Rhea are down there, we can't.."

Viewscreens: <SENSORS> SF-5726 light green beams leave the fighter heading for the old cruiser before it, the pilot bites his lips as the rays dissipate in the capital ship shields. However, he did not stop trying, sending one deadly barrage after another.

Jacen_Charles arrives from Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Jacen_Charles has arrived.
R2-D1 turns his dome toward Jacen_Charles slowly, then slowly turns away again.
Jacen_Charles enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Bazil doesn't even bother making a response to Lianna... what's there to say, anyways? With a death star, and tie fighters. And no backup forces, this time, either. "Ahh hell..." is the only thing he can manage to utter out, as he barely listens to the transmissions. "Do you know where everyone else is?" he finally manages to get out, his face looking entirely upon the action.

Viewscreens: <SENSORS> CS-7739 The shiny cruiseliner may be for pleasure, and it's intentions are to simply get the hells out of Gastus so the saying goes, but it is well defended.. A barrage of red lasers shoot out toward it's attackers, in more of a defensive arrangement than anything else.. Another battery near the front, swivels to target..

Rushing into the sprawling bar as the fighters pour into view, Feylin scans the crowd for anyone whom she might recognize. The unsettled look on her flushed features transforms to worry as she catches a glimpse of the amassing squadron. Words stuck in her throat, she simply makes her way towards the bar and grasps absently for something to steady herself. The eminant horror sinks in, and she stares, wide-eyed at the oncoming silvery darts.

Viewscreens: <SPACE> The muzzles of the giant space station begins to glow green. Then various, small, green laser shoot out from along the rim of the concave cratermuzzle housing. The lasers shoot into a conical shape over the crater. Then a larger beam shoots from the center of the depression. The Death Star fires it's destructive planet smashing laser beam into the very core of the planet. Seconds later the world explodes, erupting into an expanding cloud of meteorites, rocks, sparks, planetary crust and core. The world is destroyed. Wiped out in once split second. Devestation the likes of which the universe hasn't seen in more than a decade. Emperor Valak has made true on his promise to bring the universe to it's knees. A Death Star, complete and operation. Constructed in secret for who knows how long...now at the control of the universe's most dangerous character, Emperor Valak.

Watching as the TIEs spew forth their constant barage of bolts, Lando's muscles tense, ready for action, "There must be something we can do..." he both decrees and questions. But what can be done? The Lady Luck has no weapons and it's not like this cruise liner has its own squadron of fighters.

Altair comes dashing out of the hotel, looking as if she had been awoken from a sound sleep. Her hair sticks out in every which direction and she is wearing her pajamas. Why was the pilot sleeping in the middle of the day? How odd. Her eyes as she exits the entrance to the hotel are rivetted to the viewsceens scattered about. "Force," she whispers. "Force force force force." Tearing her eyes away from the viewscreen, seh dashes towards the first NR person she sees, who just so happens to be Bazil. "We've got to get back to the Del!" she yells at him.

Arands arrives from Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor
Arands has arrived.
R2-D1 bleeps a friendly greeting in Arands's direction.
Arands enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Bazil mumbles loudly, and then mutters out, standing next to Lianna, "But.. everyone is still on board. It would take ages to get them all rounded up!" He stares up again, as the planet meets it's firey doom... there were people on that planet... or at least, headed there...

Viewscreens: <SENSORS> CS-7739 As the planet explodes violently.. the Angry Rancor is buffetted by the blast.. sending it shaking as the pilot finally manages to coax the coordinates for a hyper jump out of the computer.. Just as the shockwave nears the shiny pleasure cruiser, it flickers and streaks away into nothingness.

"No time like the present." Gabrielle whispers to herself, steadying her steps as she heads out towards the hangar.

Lianna shakes her head at Bazil. "There was none in the Casino.", she mutters, stunned at the display of destruction unraveling before her eyes. To listen to the stories that have been told of Alderaans destruction are by no means able to recapture the horror of whitnessing it by oneself.

Morganna arrives from Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Morganna has arrived.
R2-D1 doesn't seem to notice Morganna enter the area. He continues to look about the area curiously.
Morganna enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Over the com, the breathless female voice pauses... then professionally states, "Ladies and Gentlebeings.. we are clear of..." her voice cracks a little, "..Gastus space.. We will be arriving in Caspar orbit momentarily.. We can't explain just what happened.."

Kartijan arrives from Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor
Kartijan has arrived.
Kartijan enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

And Sam slips slightly on the floor, but quickly regains his balance and just stares as the planet is blown apart in chunks of rock and matter. He shakes his head slowly as he looks about himself and then he shakes his head once again, "Frag." Is the first word that leaves his mouth, "How the..." He decides not to ask that question and just finishes steadying himself.

Before the Death Star lets loose the planet-destroying laser beam, Skywalker cringes, then sinks against the nearest wall. He watches in horror as the planet is turned to rubble, and the ship shudders in the aftershocks of the explosion. "No. It's Valak...." Ignoring all the other people in the room, despite reaching for Lando's arm to steady himself, he bends his head, bringing his fingers to his temple. The cries of those perishing reach him through the Force, and he has to consciously control the sensations to keep from being overwhelmed. "No..."

Bazil shrieks as the ship shudders, sending him toppling to the floor. As the ship once again settles, he stands. Blinking at the hyperspace entry, he tries to regain composure... everything happened so fast. He just stands there, slightly stunned, and finally manages to nod at Lianna, before turning to Altair, "The Del..." It's the only thing he manages to get out. Whether it's a question, or a statement, is impossible to tell.

Jacen_Charles heads into Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor
Jacen_Charles has left.

"Oh force," Altair mutters again as the planet explodes before their eyes on the viewscreen. Just as the horror begins to register, the exploding planet fragements streak into the star lines of hyperspace. Feeling an eerie sort of calm settling over her, the Colonel ceases her panicked yelling at her pilots and runs a weary hand through her frazzled hair. "Grief," she mutters.
She's stunned.

Just as Feylin had picked her companion's face from the crowd, Luke's blond form standing closely with the tawny visiage of Lando, the planet that was to be their destination exploded. A vision of terror burst forth in flames before the eyes of the entire amassing of sentients who had boarded the magnificent ship in hopes of a vacation full of peace and plush accomodations. Instead, this monstrocity that was done in the Slice would be forever burned into the memories of all present. "Luke..." Is whispered in a voice no one would even be capable of hearing, her knees buckling slightly, and with a hand stil firmly gripped on a nearby chair, she simply lowers herself to the floor.

He's seen that awesome force unleashed upon a Calamari Cruiser, but he'd seen capital ships destroyed before (granted not with one single blast but the effect was similar). But an entire planet? Calrissian simply stares at the meteor shower that was once a thriving planet brimming with life. All of that erased to nothingness in a matter of seconds, it's almost unfathomable. He continues to stare until it appears that the effects of that space station's blast were also unleashed upon his friend in some way, "Luke! Luke, are you okay?" he asks, grabbing his friend to keep him from falling.

Just as the terrifying events take place, morganna had stepped into the lounge, with a full view of the ports. Right outside of the Hotel. Her eyes widen in horror and in sheer sadistic glee as the cries of the doomed also reach her. She closes her eyes and savours the shrieks. The only thing that snaps Morganna out of her little reverie is the sheer fact that now.. she's.. alone.. on.. the.. AR... with.. "ooooh.. fark.." Morganna inhales sharply as she manages to cut through the fear and anger in the crowd to spot that bright point of light. The ship.. she can get to the hangar and.. no.. her eyes rapidly move to the viewports. Hyperspace.. trapped..

The mottled blue of hyperspace recedes in a moment to be replaced by the deep inky black of space. Outside the viewing windows is the planet Caspar.

Lianna turns her glance away from the Viewscreens as the ship makes the jump to the lightspeed, and places it on altair and Bazil. She cannot possible pale more, that is obviously of benefit in situations like those, but her eyes are all you need to see to realize that Lianna is still trying to cope with what she just saw. It takes a while until she manages to speak again. "Number Three?", she almost whispers.

Kartijan is running in from the hangar, looking for people she knows. Maybe hoping somebody can tell her why she was being shaken up on her ship...she had exited in time to hear about reaching Caspar shortly and seems to be too busy looking for someone to look out the windows. He expression is a mizture of many emotions, none look good right now.

Still standing just outside the Hotel, Sam lets out a long sigh as he sees the familiar sight of Caspian Space outside the viewports. He takes a few more breaths and shakes his head slightly. How did they? Wait, that doesn't matter. From behind him, he hears a voice that he may recognise, but he doesn't turn around to see it. His eyes stay on the people in front of him.

Bazil shakes his head, his eyes focused on the viewscreen which so recently showed the utmost destruction... "How... all our latest intel reports... they didn't have a chance... so many people... dead..." The shock is visible in even his voice. He stutters softly, trying to comprehend everything... He turns his head to Altair again, and utters out, "We need to get a message home... we need to warn them..."

Arands emerges from the hotel a few moments later. He had been in his room when the Death Star appeared. He had remained looking out that viewport for a very long time - from the moment the space station appeared until the moment the Rancor entered hyperspace. The Rebellion had not had enough ships for him to fly against the first Death Star. He had not been among the Rebellion for the second Death Star. Now it appeared the odds had rolled against him. He would have to face this Death Star. His face is pale as he brushes past Morganna without even registering who she is. His bag is over one shoulder and his hand is on his sidearm as he glances around the lounge looking for his people.

"I'm all right," Luke says to reassure Lando, aware of Morganna's presence, but at the moment not really caring. He flashes her a look, his expression pained as he straightens up. The mottled view of hyperspace around them accompanies the strange calm that's come upon them, and he breathes out a long sigh. "How many times do we have to blow that thing up before they get the hint?" The attempt at levity is perhaps out of place, but the feeling of helplessness is overwhelming and there's nothing to be said or done until they can contact the Fleet to inform them. The Jedi spots Feylin wilting to the floor, and frowns, waving for Lando to follow him as he trots over to the bar and kneels beside her. "Feylin, are you okay?"

Kartijan moves among the people as she moves about the room, still avoiding looking at the windows and trying not to hear what the people are saying so she can stay focused on what she is doing, continuing to search through the faces.

Bazil gives up on Altair, and begins performing a search around the lounge quickly, for someone... and finds him. Arands, standing there, the bag slung over his shoulder. Bazil starts off towards him, offering out a quite-audible, if not cryptic, "Archer!" as an attempt to catch his attention. He seems to be the only one not completely dazed so far... and in the most action. He hopes, anyways, as he continues forwards towards him.

No sabers, no attacks.. no hyperspace .. Morganna allows herself a sigh of relief as she scans the room for a safe exit point. As much as the cat eyed woman would love to laugh and make it clear that the empire is soo much better than everyone else, even her demon knows when it is outnumbered.. but.. just in case. Morganna places a hand on Sam's shoulder ansd whispers into his ear. "I promised you I'd take you back to Selene.." she hises, "You're coming with me.." Despite her unease, Morganna's voice is strong and confident. Inside, she's screaming and cheering at the same time.

Now, for some reason, Sam's back arches as the hand touches his shoulder. Why, of all places, there? Now what can he say? No, sorry, I- Oh, forget it. Sam just nods slowly, "Alright..." Is the one word that comes out; Well, this will be fun. He knows, from experience, that wriggling would just be stupid, and so waits to be directed; What a predicament to find oneself in. He shakes his head again, "Now." He says, finally.

Lianna is dazed and shaken all right. For as the initial shock is wearing off, her technical competence starts kicking in. And this is telling her that blasting up this one won't be as "easy" as the prior two. The Empire is - regardless what else you can attribute to the, - not stupid and would have taken time to get rid of prior "design flaws". And all of this, is threating to make Lianna despair even before she can consider the possibilities to destroy this destructive tool.

"I..." Feylin says absently, still staring through the port windows that now display a whole new planet, almost replacing the one that was just moments ago burst into nothingness. It would be easy for the naive Tatooinn native to convince herself that nothing had acctually happened. A planet is in her sight now, it could possibly be the same one that she just saw a moment...No. She knows better, and her clear-blue, tear filled eyes tear themselves from the image of Caspar to look up to the somber Jedi Knight now hovering by her side. "By the Force." Is all that she manages, a horace whisper barely heard above the rushing of the blood in her ears. She tries to stand, lifting herself up with aid of the chair that she's white-knuckling. And finally, with total disbelief in her voice, she looks frightenedly towards Luke. "What just happened?"

"How could they have built that thing without us knowing?" Lando wonders aloud, echoing Bazil's sentiments. He trots along, beside Luke, quiping, "One Death Star is one too many." Then it dawns on him that there are other people aboard this ship. As Luke attends to the woman, Lando's mind begins to race..o O (Why would they send a squadron of TIEs after a cruise ship? It couldn't be to keep the knowledge of a third Death Star a secret. Even CSA intel could put two and two together when Gastus is there one day, and only a meteor shower is left the next. Luke said something about Valak, could they have been after him? How would they've known he was here?) Snapping out of the awed/dazed look most everyone aboard sports, Lando looks around the lounge, scanning for familiar faces....until he hits upon one through all the commotion, "General!" he calls out loudly to Arands. "We must seal off this ship! No one is to leave!"

Caspar space. At last. Arands snaps his head around at Bazil as he hears the squadron name. His look is grim, but relieved. As Bazil approaches, he nods, "Captain, I want you to get our people together. Get them to the Tiamant. We've got to get word to the Del." He casts another glance around and spots Lianna. "Lieutenant..." he says, somewhat loudly, calling her over with his the authority in his voice alone. He turns back to Bazil. "Send an emergency call to the embassy on the planet. we need the Deliverance here." He looks past Bazil. "Where is Colonel Quila?"

"She went off to the hotel, I think... damnit... our people will probably come down here to check out what's going on, first... I'll contact Caspar first, and let them know... if that death star comes into our space before word gets out, we won't be able to stop it..." Bazil offers up, and turns, not waiting for response, jogging towards the nearest exit, in search of communication.

Kartijan draws in an audible breath through her teeth as her eyes light up. Success! She spots Sam'viel, gathers up her skirts and hurries toward him, not caring where he is going, nor that there is someone with him. "Sam!" she calls as she catches up to him, "I heard the announcement about Caspar space as I came out of the ship t osee why things suddenly seemed turbulent."

Lianna turns at Arrands calling. More a reflex then a concious reaction, but never the less, now that she made out the General, she is moving towards him. "Sir?", she queries, still not quite able to fight the feeling of irreality off her mind.

Just shortly after Sam agrees to come with Morganna, the Moff begins to calmly move through the crowd, skirting as far away from Skywalker as she can. When Lando calls out to seal the ship, Morganna grabs Sam and nearly picks him up off the ground as she begins to launch into a full run towards the hangar. She closes her eyes and driven by fear and anger, a few chairs blocking her path skitter away as though they fear the woman, but the sentients are another matter. Far more difficult obstacles to clear out of the way with this many distractions, and Sam makes a wonderful shield, but also slows her down.

Arands hears Lando now as Bazil makes his departure and turns his head back the way he came. He spots Lando, with Luke and Feylin behind him and furrows a brow quizzically as if he doesn't understand Calrissian's intentions with his orders. As Lando nears, "You're joking, right? Stop all these terrified people from getting off this ship? Half of them are powering up as we speak!" he says over the screams and noise of the passengers trying to get past him.

You paged Sargent with '(IC Communication from Space) *crackle* This is Captain Bazil McKenzie, StarOps to anyone who can read this message. We have just been attacked by a death star, and several ISDs. Contact the Deliverance and have them come to Casperian space ASAP. This is an emergency. The planet Gastus has been destroyed by the death star. Repeat, contact the Deliverance, and have them arrive at Caspar as soon as possible. This is *NOT* a drill.'.

Just shortly after Sam agrees to come with Morganna, the Moff begins to calmly move through the crowd, skirting as far away from Skywalker as she can. When Lando calls out to seal the ship, Morganna grabs Sam and nearly picks him up off the ground as she begins to launch into a full run towards the hangar.

Far more difficult obstacles to clear out of the way with this many distractions, and Sam makes a wonderful shield, but also slows her down. (for sam)

Well, this has definately been an interesting day and it just seems to get better and better and now his feet aren't even touching the floor, literally. Sam is just about to open his mouth to speak as he is hoisted up, "Oh Frag." Is all that comes out as he goes up. But surprisingly, he doesn't seem too bothered to shout out, or cry out. After all? What would be the point? Get more people hurt than neccessary. He just shakes his head slightly. Why didn't she just garb hold of him and pull him along?

Luke watches as Lando heads for the general, and then helps Feylin to her feet, not knowing where to begin to explain. "It was a battle station. Built by the Empire." Seems like I have to face one every four or five years, he adds silently to himself. The commotion in the lounge gets louder and he sees Morganna racing across the carpeted floor with an apparent hostage. "Someone stop her!" he calls out even as he realizes he's the best one for the job. The Jedi makes a minute gesture with his hand, in effect tugging on both of the Moff's feet to bring her to her knees.

Kartijan draws in an audible breath through her teeth as her eyes light up. Success! She spots Sam'viel, gathers up her skirts and hurries toward him, not caring where he is going, nor that there is someone with him. "Sam!" she calls as she catches up to him, "I heard the announcement about Caspar space as I came out of the ship t osee why things suddenly seemed turbu...." She stops suddenly as Sam is picked up and used as a human shield coming at her.

Bazil returns to the room, almost a full sprint, towards Arands, fighting through the traffic. As he arrives, he offers to the man, "General, I've contacted the planet... if all goes well, the Deliverance should be here as soon as possible." Almost suddenly, he blinks, realizing the panic ensuing around him. "Force... it's a zoo..." he utters out...

"Blasts!" is Lando's reply to the General's question. "There's no time to explain, just do it!" he exclaims. "Damnit!" he bellows as Luke issues his own order. Fighting past the hordes of frantic passengers he grabs hold of the nearest member of the crew, "I need to get a message up to your captain now!" he barks out. The crewmember begins to protest feebly, but eventually relinquishes his comlink. "Captain, this is Lando Calrissian of the New Republic. In accordance with the Coruscant treaty signed by the New Republic and Caspar shortly after the Battle of Endor, this ship must be quarantined, and no passengers allowed to leave until this ship has been completely scanned for any radiation leaks." his voice is at once forceful and persuasive.

Sargent pages: (IC communication) This is Eva Sargent, Diplomatic Representative. I read your communication. I will contact the Deliverance immediately.

People getting in her way.. all over the place.. Morganna runs with ehr eyes closedm, relying on other senses to get her through this mess. She has learned that her visual senses can be confusing in chaotic circumstances. Morganna only opens her eyes as she realises that someone /isn't/ getting out of her way and she bares her teeth, raising a hand as she draws on her abilities to push Kart out of her path.. just as the shockwave hits. The sith-Moff stumbles over an invisible obstacle and releases Sam, falling towards the carpeted floor. As she falls, the invisible blast intended for Kartijan slams into a table instead, splintering wood and breaking angy glassesnthat had managed to stay on it from the.. event. As soon as Morganna hits the ground her body tenses as she gets into position to stand.

You paged Sargent with '(IC) Thank you Sargent... please alert Casperian command, as well, if you could...'.

Arands is already pushing towards the exit and catches Lianna's arm with one hand. "Let's move Lieutenant..." He spots Bazil cutting through the crowd and Bazil's exclamation is drowned out by Luke's own shout from some distance behind him. Sith if that farmboy didn't have a set of lungs. But the General reacts by keying his comlink, already in his hand. "Tango Team - stop anyone trying to board any ships. Fire warning shots if you have to." Arands knows that Bazil will respond to the comlink call as well as he is closer to the hangar bay.

Sargent pages: (IC) Sargent to Captain McKenzie. The Deliverance is now en route to Casparian space. Will contact Casparian command.

The comlink held by Lando crackles as a small tinny voice comes over, "Mr. Calrissian.. this isn't the Captain he's presumed dead back there. This is Lt. McCormick, first officer.." the com silences for a brief pause, "..you actually expect me to keep people from taking off? Did you even /see/ what happened back there? The ship is damaged sir.. we don't even know if we're being pursued or not."

Bazil curses to himself loudly, unaudible under the panic. He stops abruptly, turns, and darts for the hangar bay, already drawing out his carbine, setting it to stun, keeping it pointed to the floor at the side of his leg as he goes. The comlink darts into his hand from some concealed pocket, and Bazil utters out, "General, I'm on my way in already... I'll do everything I can. Caspar and the Del have been alerted." He ducks inside the hangar with that...




Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor
This hangar is large, but not enormous. Ships landing here settle into the Angry Rancor from the large beveled opening above. It is usually open, and magnetically shielded, allowing full view of the stars beyond, and any approaching vessels. There is one large blast door which has been decorated to -not- look so much like a blast door, near the Port wall. A sign blinking over it reads, "Guest Reception and Lucky Krayt Lounge". At the fore, there is a sealed corridor with security mechanism leading to the bridge. There is another giant sized door for taking cargo down into the belly of the ship.. There is a metal cage grating over the door, suggesting that this is where live cargo is loaded and led into the holding pens below the arena. The floors here are crisp and clean, cleaner than most starships, and buffed to a dark glossy sheen. There are greeters here, amicably greeting anyone landing on the ship and handing them a booklet with information about the cruiseliner and doing anything they require to get settled in.

A large sign hangs here that says, "Welcome to The Angry Rancor. Enjoy your stay."

OOC: This ship has extensive help and guest/admin commands. Please see ARHELP for more information.

Bazil enters Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor

Bazil rushes into the hangar, with the rest of the masses, and makes his way to the control booth, yelling at the persons inside to lock down the hangar. In panic, he is pushes sideways by a pair of panickers, and he grumbles, before rushing around, trying to keep order. Several others follow his lead, and begin ordering people away from the ships, blasters drawn.




Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor
The nexus and reception center of this luxurious ship is an open-space extravaganza, replete with plush seating and decor of impeccable taste and decadence. The lounge is large, a vault, and boasts a segmented glass ceiling that allows passengers to view the starscape while in transit. The ribs of the structure are articulated in pleasing curves with pewter moldings of creatures from all over the galaxy, like gargoyles at stress points.
        The stained oak-panelled walls harbor display cases for animals of various sizes and environments, each cage fitted with an informational plaque next to it. Tables are situated throughout the room and draped in red velvet tablecloths, many being dangerously close to the cages housing the exotic animals. A bar rests at the end of the vault, offering a variety of drinks, and gold droids move about frequently to refill the stray glass or empty plate. In one corner, tucked away behind lush foliage is a huge mahagany-panelled hot tub and sauna.
        All in all, an amazing space with amazing views and the ultimate in spacefaring comfort and enjoyment.

Bazil enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Tango Team> Tango Team continually pushes the surfing crowds away from the ships, weapons pointed, darting between people. Shouts of "Stay Back!" and "We'll fire if we have to!" are ushered forth.

"Lt. McCormick I know full well full well what happend back there!" Lando clamors into the comlink irritably. "Caspian officials have been alerted of our presence and will offer protection if we were followed." he tries to sound more reassuring now, trying to pull this con off. "There's little time to explain Lt. so you'll just have to take my word for it, but the short version is that if we let passangers leave here without proper medical clearance we could be looking at an outbreak of..." his voice falters for just a moment as he tries to think of something, "radiation disease," he finally chimes in, sounding liking he's not only trying to convince the Lt. but himself as well, "that would wreak more havoc on the galaxy than that space station just did. I wouldn't want that on my head Lt. Would you?"

Tango Team> Ambar woonders what is afoot now. cops theatening to shoot people on a passenger liner. this outa be amusing. She leans over and ask the closest person "What is up with the jawa patrol?"

Bazil pushes his way back into the area, and shoving the crowds of people out of his way, as he tries to find his way towards the Arands again. He realizes he still has the comlink in hand, and lifts it to his mouth, "General... the hangar is secured for the most part. My team is blocking all access to the ships. The people are surging, though... I don't know how much longer we can hold them."

"Mr. Calrissian.." the small tinny voice says over the comlink, and sighing wearily.. "..alright. But I want the New Republic and Caspian assurances that this ship and its guests will be protected if a whole buncha Star Destroyers come out of hyperspace shooting at us. I'm closing the bay doors.."

Tango Team> The person, a very panicked woman with a child, dressed in an evening gown has a very horrified look on her face, as she turns towards Ambar, and shakily says, "A... death star... another one... Gastus... gone... all those people." Screams are uttered out a ways away as a guard fires a warning shot into the air, the blue light of the stun ray flying into space.

Though he does not have a chance to react outwardly to Feylin's understanding, Luke is inwardly grateful for it as his eyes now turn to focus solely on Morganna and the commotion that the little Sithling is causing this time. He remembers not having taken her seriously enough in the past, and a familiar and cruel pain closes around his heart as his steps toward Morganna grow faster with purpose, his eyes narrowing into angry blue slits. The aura he projects is nothing like his usual calm glow; instead his intent is frighteningly powerful and calculated, but losing control.

Arands' Kylan has already cleared leather and he's on his way to the site of the exploding table. He can't see Morganna now or Sam, but he shoves his way in that direction anyway. He sees Lianna draw her own blaster and shouts, "Get to the security team. Make sure our people get aboard!" As loud as he is, he isn't sure if Lianna can hear him now as she is leading him towards the splintered table. Arands figures most of the danger is here in the lounge though and clicks him comlink. "Captain, cover the exit. Look for a possible hostage situation." He finally breaks free from the crowd moving with him towards the exit, many of which have scattered from around the splintered table. Arands spots Sam'viel on the ground.

Bazil blinks... hostage... situation? What the hell is going on in here, he wonders to himself, as he waves his blaster around, trying to get people to get out of the way as he heads to the exit -- again. Standing there, he peers out over the heads of the people... looking for anything. Behind him, in the hangars, people scream and surge, trying to get to their precious ships.

Tango Team> Ambar shakes her head and leans up against the wall. Then deicing the better of it she takes a brief climb up onto somr parts crates. Once she is up she turns around and yells in that command voice that only marines truly manage. "Alright Everybody Quiet down and Be still for a moment. Think for a Moment!!!" She pause seeing if she has the crowd or not.

Kelvis blinks a few times, people running around in chaos, and confusion. People waving blaster, a Jedi stalking after someone. Exploding tables, more people running in confusion. He shakes his head, "Definately time for some caf." He mutters to himself, and turns, fighting his way to the bar. Apparently the Quarren doesn't wake quickly, as any normal being would have thier adreniline rushing by now.

Sargent pages: (IC) Sargent to Captain McKenzie. Casparian command has been contacted. The Deliverance has been given permission to enter Casparian space.

You paged Sargent with '(IC) Understood Eva... thank you!'.

She has grown stronger since Luke last had to face her, but Morganna is by no means an even match against the master. Nonetheless, Morganna doesn't intend to be taken down without a fight. Tye cat eyed woman snaps to her feet in a fluid, acrobatic motion and growls as Luke approaches. Focusing all of her hatred on him, she pushes at another table, hoping to buy her some time.. Buy some time for what? Morganna stands her ground. She has nowhere to run, and so she moves her hand towards that hidden part of her jacket, despite the frantic air about the room, it almost feels as though everything's moving in slow motion to Morgs.. So slow..

SHIP: "Attention passengers." The delicious female voice says over the speakers, "On authority of New Republic and Caspian officials.. this ship has been ordered to close her bay doors. I'm afraid no ships will be able to leave until this mess is straightened out."

Sargent pages: (IC) You're welcome, Captain. Good luck.

Wether Lianna hear arands or not remains her secret, but she is pulling forward towards the splintered table and wherever she esimate Sam'viel had landed. Oh, yes, and wherever Morganna has landed. She won't forget about that. HEr blaster is pointed at the ground, keeping it in a double-hand grip, only loosesning it for a moment, to switch it to the kill setting, tather then the original setting she uses when abord spaceships. "SAM?!", she calls out, trying to get through.

Tango Team> She not only doesn't have the control, but unfortunately, time is at an end for the people in the bay. Suddenly, the bay doors begin closing. More people scream and panic, bumping into the crates as they try furiously to get to their ships.

Tango Team> Ambar chuckles as she watches this throng. there is a Death star outside and they want to be the first ones to test the Imperials resolve in keeping it a secret. Oh well might as well watch. Civialians what can you do?

Tango Team> Both 'security' beings around the Tiamant suddenly go active. Both the Devaronian and the human have their assault carbines ready and are covering the ship. A comlink call notifies their teammates on Tango Team of their presence. The four commandos spread out around the Tiamant, which is closest to the starboard entrance to the ship. Three keep assault rifles trained on the door while the fourth covers his teammates.

Sam seems to slip back into the slipstream of reality finally and his hand slips down to the XiX blaster displayed prominently at his waist. He flicks it up into his hand, but still only looks between Jedi and Mo- No, Jedi, until his name is called above the crowds. He shakes his head towards the oncoming fight; What Earthly good could he do. He looks about himself quickly and soon finds the source of the voice; Lianna. He slips through the crowds which rush about the welcoming Lounge, not noting the others who glance towards him and soon he actually catches sight of her. And within just a few more seconds, he is beside her. He lets out a slow breath and his first words are, "Are you alright?" Hmmm, wasn't he the one almost carried off?

"You have my word Lt." Lando utters into the device, affording himself a brief 'I've still got it' smile. "I'll be up on the bridge momentarily, but before I do I'm going to try and restore order down here. If you would please send any crew members you can spare down here to help calm down the passangers, it would go a long way towards getting all of this resolved." His voice is immeasuarably calmer now, more in control.

Tango Team> Ambar Slowly eases down from her postion and ambles into the casino or at least the reception room. sure bets getting shot by an idiot with a itchy trigger finger

A grim smile twists Luke's lips as he draws closer to Morganna, noticing each of her movements with lucid eyes. She may have grown stronger, but the Jedi Master knows she is no match for his powers if he chooses to use them on her. He hasn't in the past. He always held back. And because of that, Reine had suffered and died a horrible death. Without pausing to think or gauge his actions, Luke's hand reaches for his lightsaber and ignites it, his smile turning menacingly as he swings it almost teasingly -- but threateningly, in the Sithling's direction. "Looks like you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, Morganna."

Tango Team> Ambar heads into Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor
Ambar arrives from Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor
Tango Team> Ambar has left.
Ambar has arrived.
Ambar enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Ambar smiles as she wanders in and she immediately heads for Sam. She slowly weaves her way to him through the crowd of people.

As if by silent order, a few of the security personell file into the place. They look more like tour guides though.. and don't do much good at calming the passengers.. Anyone rushing to their ship however will quickly notice that the bay doors are closed. The service staff.. knowing nothing else to do, walks through the crowd carrying trays of drinks. Most of them steer clear of the commotion with the Jedi however..

Bazil blinks as the beam of light wavers over the heads of the beings in the room. He darts for his comlink again, "Josh... what's going on in here? What should I do?" His voice is panicked, and confused.

Kartijan finds herself watching Morganna preparing for the oncoming battle as Sam is a ways off approaching a vaguely familiar woman who has approached the table that had taken the force blast which had been meant for Kart herself. In confusion Kart spins and searches once more, finally spotting Sam and again heads for him, gethering her skirts for ease of movement as she agains rushes to join him regardless of where he is going, nor whom he may be with, too...something..to even call out to him yet.

With deadly symmetry, the Moff withdraws a similar, cylindrical object from within her jacket and thumbs a swith. A shapp hiss sound is accompanied by a pang of ozone as a blade, as amber and furious as her eyes, springs from the hilt, bathing her in its soft light. Morganna pulls her thoughts around her choosing to wait for an attack.. maybe - just maybe.. she'll last more than a few seconds longer. Morganna's cat eyes narrow and she snarls, "Didn't farking expect you rto be here, Skywalker.. Let me go and I won't hurt anyone.." Morganna wincers a little, as the words come out with a slightly more fearful tone than she'd like.
Fearful, but still vicious.. liked a trapped animal

Delila arrives from Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Delila has arrived.
R2-D1 turns his dome and glances at Delila with curiosity as she enters the area.
Delila enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor
Coda arrives from Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Coda has arrived.
Coda enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Luke laughs almost contemptuously as he batters his blade for the first time against Morganna's lightsaber. "Oh, no, you're not going to hurt anyone, Morganna. Not this time." He doesn't hesitate to press the attack, the lightsaber moving in a deadly arc as he attempts to push her back toward the wall.

Lianna stops, her blaster still pointed down to the floor, now that Sam'viel is suddenly at her side. "Are you?", is her reply, eyeing him breifly, then gazes at the two blades igniting right in front of her. Something tells her that during her previous dealings with Morganna, she was kind of lucky.

Coda steps in behind Delila, a silver chain lacing from her hand up to the collar about his neck.

Kelvis reaches the bar, and seeing that the bartender has abandoned his post, he climbs over, looking around. He sighs, all the cups.. ah ha! There is one. He glances up to see that lightsabers have been ignited... nice of the ship to go to such trouble to recreate... which story is this. Caf... oh that's right, he was here to get a cup of caf. His head starts to search for the pot. Everything will make sense with a cup of caf.

The lounge has emptied sufficiently now that the remaining passengers can move either into the casino or hotel, or possibly slide past Bazil and the security team near the exit to the hangar. Arands keys his comlink once more. "Civilians coming out. Stand down and maintain security over the Tiamant. Team Tango - coordinate all New Republic personnel to the Tiamant. Captain McKenzie, back off... stay clear." Arands meanwhile has moved nearer to Lianna and Sam and the bar behind them.

The crackling blaze of lightsabers is enough to startle Feylin into backing away from Luke. Her instincts rage through her brain, and for the second time this evening she finds herself stumbling through crowds of people to get away from something she doesn't quite understand. It's all a little too surreal for the young lady who had never even left her home planet until less than two weeks ago. The whole situation looks alot like something from an imported holoflick -- Bobbling trays filled with expensive drinks, the hiss and hum of ancient weapons, people crying and shouting orders. This definately is a touch out of the realm of Feylin's slowly opening mind. With her back safely up against the wall, she holds herself steady to watch the ensuing events.

Whether it's sheer luck, or that her senses are in tune, Morganna manages to block the jedi master's deadly arc, sparks flying from the sabers as they clash together. Skywalker's intention to pusth her towareds the wall works, as Morganna only has that way to go to avoid the incoming swings from luke's saber. Anger mixered with a heallthy dose of terror fills Morganna's eyes, she parts her blade from Luke's and takes a forceful swing at him, although it is clear from her stance that she is nowhere near as good as Luke.

Chaos reins supreme, and admist the cacphony of panick and disorder a few calming voices interject. One of the beloning to Lando Calrissian. Doing exactly what he told Lt. McCormick he would do, he sets about trying to calm the passangers, "Please, please." he calls out in as soothing a voice as he can muster, "If you will all please remain calm. I know what we have just witnessed was horrible but we are free of that now and on friendly ground. By order of Caspian government this entire ship has been quarantined until the radiation leaks in the reactor core can be locked down. No one can leave the ship so attempting to do so is futile. Please return to your cabins until the quarantine has been lifted." While he has some success at first, a lightsaber duel is an oddity to most and might tend to make them a little jittery. "Blasts!" Lando curses softly.

Delila walks in with a good amount of frustration plastered on her innocent face. Her bags are in one hand, Coda's leash in another. "Hey....hey excuse me! I need to get off this ship. Caspar isn't all that far away and I have a busin---- uh oh...." What was this?! Morganna and that blonde-haired guy were going at it, and from her experience with the headstrong woman, something bad would surely ensue. The luggage just plops to the floor as Delila just stares in shock and looks on. There was -no- talking her out of this, she didn't feel exactly comfortable being near those things. Lucky for everyone they were not blasters or a coniption courtesy of Miss Dmitri would be in order.

Bazil mumbles, and nods to his comlink, and then wavers away from the exit, letting the remaining security deal with it. He sets his course around the room for the various other personnel. He spots Kelvis, chuckling to himself as the being has apparrently commandeered the bar. Avoiding the battle easily, he works his way towards it briskly, finally arriving, "Hey, Kelvis... we need to get to the Tiamant. It's time to go."

Glancing back towards the fight, Sam shakes his head, before looking to Lianna, "Yes..." Is his answer, before his gaze once again flicks towards the lightsabers. He shuts his eyes for just a second, and takes a slow breath. It's not much, but he soon opens his eyes, and is looking a little more relaxed. He looks around the Lounge quickly and then back to LiannaAre you?" He re-iterates his question, just before the lightsabers finally make contact. He almost makes some kind of move, but holds himself back, and just continues to watch.

The throngs of People and General commotion impedes Ambar But not Nearly as much as the spang of the crossed light Sabers. She Looks to the noise and then moves to the through till she can see the two clearly. one hand floats up inside her jacket. She focus her attnetion o the duel not really careing about much else.

Johanna enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Kelvis finds the caf pot, and pours what little there is in the cup. He glances up at Bazil, only hearing a few of the words through the overall noise, "What?" He glances around, and takes a sip of his caf. Everything snaps into focus now, and the Quarren.. well, no.. he just sips the caf agian, still as lost as he was before. "Cold." He mutters, and salutes Bazil, and Arands, who he happens to catch sight of for a few seconds. He appears to be a bit of blissfully unaware calm in the storm.

Delila keeps her eyes on Morganna. Circumstances had it so that she hoped she would not get too beat up, though whoever that guy was seemed more skilled. At the same time she just wanted to get out. The young CEO wasn't exactly the most agile woman, so she clambors to a familar face....Lando. "Mr Lando, I need to get off this thing! I can't afford to be stuck like this." Her green eyes look sadly and with a touch of hope up at him. "I'm sure you can understand?"

"Kelvis!" Bazil shouts over the commotion, "We have to get out of here! Get to the Tiamant, and lose the Caf!" He grumbles, hoping the squid heard him, before turning to look for others...

Coda follows behind Delila, the chain giving him little choice, though he seems little bothered by the commotion.

Lianna nods, "Yes.", she says, monosylabic. But then, there is propably not much to talk about while you watch a lightsaber duel. If not for Skywalker she would be tempted to raise her blaster at Morganna, but that way...she remebers she lost a General somewhere back behind those people she pushed through. Turning, she watches where Arands is?

Kelvis blinks at Bazil, and as he turns to leave, shakes his head, "We have to go?! Go where?!" It's doubtful that Bazil could hear the Quarren, even though he did half shout it. He shakes his head, and looks for a warming unit, cold caf is aweful. He glances up to the duel again, hmmm, if it's like most of the old stories, the person who is seriously outclassed usually wins. He finds a warmer, and pops his mug in, setting the timer.

"Nobody's getting off this ship sister." Lando replies almost reflexively, before even knowing who he's talking to, his attention divided between getting people out of this room and Luke's on-going battle. He finally looks to see who's accosted him and finds CEO Dmitri. He gives her a glance of recognition, one that seems to say 'Oh, it's you.' Hardly the charming fanfare you'd usually expect, but then again these are hardly 'usual' circumstances, "Ms. Dmitri," he says grabbing hold of one of her arms and leading her towards an exit, "This ship has been quarantined by the Caspian government. There is no way to leave until we've been cleared so I suggest you return to your quarters until you are called for."

Bazil blinks. Somehow, he mananges to here the beep of the timer from the warmer... scowling reflexively, he turns, and leaps over the bar in one fell swoop, screaming towards Kelvis, "To the Tiamant! We have to go! Shoo!" He waves his hands at Kelvis, and points towards the hangar wildly.

Altair comes out of the Casino, her standard issue blaster dangling from one hand. At least the rest of the passengers seemed relatively unharmed. As she comes back into the main welcoming area, she pauses to replace the blaster into the pocket where she had been keeping it. Pushing the wisps of loose hair out of her face, the colonel moves towards the bar, feeling like a good drink would be helpful.

With an almost insulting casualness of ease, Luke's skillful attack presses on, the hum of the lightsaber singing out in rhythm with his movements as Morganna's back makes contact with the wall. His face is grim and his eyes narrowed with a barely controlled emotion as he whispers to her. "You're too reckless, Morganna," he says, hating himself for relishing her fear of him. "Do you think I don't blame you for what happened? Do you know how easy it would be for me to kill you?" he asks, even his body coming close enough to touch hers.

Delila does -not- like be be grabbed. It makes her mind reflex back to the few months she was tortured by some wonderful OOAG members. Her emotions snap in two and just as Lando isn't the seductive guy he tries to be, nor is she the cute innocent little racer. Her legs comes around and slams hard into Lando and she yells with biting anger. "HEY!! Let go of me you *censored*! You know I'd just thought I'd ask!" Her tiny hand balls up into a fist and beats Lando over the head......still dragging poor Coda behind. "You don't need to drag me around I can find my own room!" The scene would look comical if there wasn't a duel going on not too many feet away.

As Morganna's back hits the wall, something insicde of her snaps.. a pang of terror that has been suppressed for so long. Momentarily forgetting who has trapped her, and that both he and she have a lightsabre, morganna launches an attack that usually isn't wise to pull on a jedi. She Sends a ferocious punch towards the jedi Master which is speeded by her abilities. Her demon takes over, confused by terror and the power that it has not felt in so long, but Morganna struggles to snap herself back into control.. the first indication comes as a growl "Kill me then.."

You paged Sargent with '(IC) Eva... have you gotten any more word from Caspar or the Deliverance? It's hectic up here, but under control for the moment...'.

Kelvis manages to pull the now steaming cup of caf out of the warmer, before Bazil jumps the counter, and starts screaming. His automatic reaction, and since his mind is not quite awake yet, is to fling the steaming liquid into Bazil's face. Which he does. He totally misses the pilot's words as a result. When he sees who it is, he gets angry, "What in the SITH are you doing?! If I had a fraggin' blaster, you'd be dead!!!! And you made me waste my caf, you bloody nerf brain!!!" Well, it appears the Quarren is finally awake, though, angry.

Sargent pages: (IC) Captain, The Deliverance is currently in Casparian space, with all appropriate permissions from the Caspian government.

You paged Sargent with '(IC) Understood, Eva... thank you again...'.

Coda lets himself get dragged along behind Delila's fist, his weight hindering her momentum.

Sargent pages: (IC) You're welcome.

Tango Team> Loy_Marin departs the STARFIGHTER: Space Yacht -- Good News via the access ramp.
Tango Team> Loy_Marin has arrived.
Tango Team> Loy_Marin enters Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor

Bazil screams as the hot Caf sears against his face, "AHHHHHH!!!" The words carry quite a distance. Bazil's hands reflexively reach up to grasp his face, trying to wipe the hot liquid off. His blaster topples to the floor, a blast firing off, and striking a few bottles of liquor on the wall, sending them splashing down over the counters, and onto the floor, "Bloody hell!" Bazil furiously rips his vest off, and wipes his face from the scalding hot liquid... finally, it drops the vest over his shoulder, his face red beyond words... like some sort of wierd candy. A nice brown stain litters the front of his shirt and pants. He shouts out, "I said, get to the Tiamant. All New Republic Personnel are to get there ASAP. Damnit..." He turns, giving up on Kelvis, agitated beyond words. He peers across the area, looking for others. Spotting Altair, he ducks, grabs his blaster, and hops the bar again, headed over to her.


Tango Team> The scene here is odd... guards keep anyone away from the Tiamant except a few beings, the hangar doors are closed, and people mill around trying to get to their ships... a useless fact of knowledge. A few still panic.

Lando has taken punches before and not reciprocated. In fact, on fairly recent incident comes to mind. That time it took no restraint on Lando's part not to react, he deserved to be punched. This time, however, it takes a good deal of restraint to not pick the woman and her 'pet' up and toss them out the nearest Airlock. Seeing as how all have been sealed off though--something which he undoubtly now curses himself for--and that she seems willing to walk away, he releases his grasp of her. And now turns his full attention to the duel taking place.

Altair intercepts Bazil as he moves towards her. Guiding him back the few steps to the bar, she orders up a fizzyglug. Then she turns her attention to Kelvis and Bazil. "Hey. Guys. We don't need any more panic in here. Let's try and keep calm, huh?" she pleads with her officers, seemingly oblivious to the lightsaber fight going on not very far away and the general horror that hangs in the air of the Angry Rancor. She seems surprisingly calm in the face of pressure. "Where's Arands? We need to get cleared to launch.. Have we done that yet?"

She's backed against the wall, but Feylin's found herself uncomfortably close to the angry Jedi and Sith. Their taut bodies trembling, the rhythmic hum of singing blades, the very scent of death lingring in the air. But the night has been too full of death, too full of distruction, and while Fey doesn't quite know what is happening between the snarling enemies, she knows that she's never seen a look on Luke's face quite like the one that's etched there now. "Luke!" She cries, hand darting to mouth in fear as it becomes apparant what is unfolding. She simply assumes that he can't even hear her in the wake of his rage, her hand trembling as it clasps over her mouth.

Coda rubs his neck around his collar, a bit chaffed from getting jerked about so, giving Delila a cursory glance before going back to affecting oblivion.

Tango Team> <OOC> Lianna says, "not here"

The release of Morganna's most primal terror lashing out at him puts Luke momentarily on the defensive, but his senses serve him well and he ducks beneath her vicious swing and turns his body so that his shoulder heaves into her midsection and crushes her against the wall. He holds her there momentarily, trying to catch his breath as he feels the anger ebbing in him at last as he finds pity for the Moff's twisted and tortured soul. He thumbs off his lightsaber and pulls one of Morganna's arms behind her back, binding her with his mind as well as his hands. "You're not going to die today. At least not by my hand. But you are going to find yourself in a detention cell where you belong."

Loy_Marin enters Welcoming Lounge -- The Angry Rancor

Over the small pilfered comlink in Lando's hand, the voice of Lt. McCormick can be heard, "Mr. Calrissian.. are you still there?" It crackles then blips again, "Looks like your warships are here.. one of them anyway.. A big ugly one named the Deliverance." The com fizzles for a moment as he finishes, "..thought you'd like to know sir. I'd like to let these passengers off as soon as possible."

Arands stops in his tracks as he sees Bazil and Kelvis at the bar. "Sith," he mutters as he sees the Quarren's actions. Raising his voice, he waves to catch kelvi's attention. Get to the Tiamant. We're leaving." Turning back to the 'scene', he looks for Lando among the thinning crowd and notices the end of the altercation with Delila. "Sith..." he mutters again, this time a bit louder. He spots Altair now and whistles at her as she confronts Bazil and Kevlius. "Colonel, let's get these people out into the hangar..." he says loudly, almost having to shout over the noise of the lightsaber duel and the occasional screams of panic.

Ambar heads into Creature Arena -- The Angry Rancor
Ambar has left.

Bazil shakes his head profusely, "Arands disappeared into the chaos... I have no clue where he went. His face is still red from the caf. He tries to calm down slowly, looking around for that very person... He has absolutely no clue where he is, unfortunately, which just adds to his attemptedly calm frustration. Finally, he notices Arands, and speaks out to him, "General... we need to get permission to depart the ship... with all those people in the hangar still, it will be a bit difficult to get out."

Kelvis blinks at Bazil, and swears, throwing his cup down angrily, smashing it to piece. He looks to the sky, and screams, probably loud enough to be heard by all, "THIS WAS MY FRAGGIN' VACATION!!!!!!" He sets about getting to the Tiamant though, since it is a safe haven. He looks at Altair, and says, "Do I look like the bartender." He being the only one behind the bar now. But he does sit a can of fizzyglug on the counter for her. He mutters a little, then calls, voice heavy in sarcasm, "The bar is open!" He grabs another nearby glass, and smashes it on the ground as well. Gee, he's REALLY ticked, but scales the bar, and, muttering darkly, waits for the other two officers to head for the exit. He's not about to leave first, not now.

The split second Lando lets go of Delila, she turns from the angry she-devil to her sweet little innocent self. It was so abrupt and sudden that it would be easily classed as disturbing. When the anger is gone, fear remains and she watches the two jedi have at it. When Morganna is all but taken away she frowns. So she could be on the losing side after all, yet this was just a bad time right now. Thoughts and ideas run through her head. Turning to Lando she apologizes, though she doubted he was paying attention. "I'm sorry Coda....I didn't mean to drag you around like that....here." The leash is unclipped and put away. "I guess I can't get myself off this thing....cmon lets go then."

The wind is knocked out of Morganna as Luke slams her against the wall. The force of the blow causes Morganna to drop her lightsabre and it falls to the carpet with a soft thump, extinguishing itself upon impact. The fight isn't quite gone from morganna ans she struggles, unsucessfully, against Luuke, her mind screaming in terror at the thought of being detained. "NO!" she growlss, trying to force her eright against Luke. A sickening pop can be heard from her shoulder as she struggles a little too hard, just before she finds herself paralyzed. The anger still burns in her eyes, but it slowly loses out to fear and pain.

Coda nods absently to Delila. "As you wish." He waits for her to take the lead.

Loy Marin, fearless newsman and previous main anchor of one of the most power media giants in the galaxy, just doesn't look like he's all there. He enters from the direction of the hangar as usual, now with three of his usual cambots, bobbing along behind him like balloons on a quiet pond. He lifts his eyes toward the duel, then lifts his hand listlessly in the direction of the scuffle as a half-hearted gesture for a camera droid to start filming. He turns his attention toward what appears to be a minor riot near the bar. Again, the half-hearted gesture, and another camera droid moves to start filming.

Delila takes Coda by the arm, and trying too hard not to be scared of what goes on. Though it does have a significant affect on her. It was not fear, but something more complicated. "I'll have to get in touch with Mizaree and Ernie......and Nerik. I hope I'm not here for too long." The abandoned bags are picked up and she waltzes right off the proverbial jedi dance floor for the nite.

Coda glances behind him with one last suggestive glance at the gathered crowd before being dragged out.

Altair had been expecting the bartender to be hiding behind the bar like he had been the night before during the trouble, but seems to have offended Kelvis. "Um, thanks, Kelv," she calls after the departing Quarren, taking the fuzzyglug anyway and popping it open. "Go, go," she says, hustling Bazil along towards the hangar bay. "Arands will try and get clearance, I guess." Having finally taken note of the lightsaber duel nearby, and it's shoulder-popping end, she moves cautiously towards Luke and the now paralyzed Sith. "Is she out?" the pilot asks cautiously, peering at Morganna.

Bazil frowns, grabbing a nearby unopened bottle of the expensive Corellian Whiskey he so favours from the bar, before rushing towards the hangar, hoping that he makes it. The jedi, and chaos don't make for a nice encounter. He blinks, watching an orb of a camera whizz over his head, towards the bar, and continues on his way. As he reaches the entrance to the hangar, he stops short, a bottle of whiskey in one hand, a vest over his shoulder, and a carbine blaster in his other hand. Now, if he doesn't look quite odd, noone does. Frowning, he turns, and exits into the hangar bay.

Delila heads into Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Delila has left.

Breathing out, Luke calms himself after the struggle to subdue Morganna wanes, keeping a tight hold of her as Altair approaches. "She can be," he says with a small shrug, his expression heavy and saddened now as he lifts one hand to Morganna's temple, and watches her angry and terrified expression fade and those cat eyes close as he sends her into a deep sleep. He catches her deadweight in his arms, then smirks at the pilot nearby. "Who's going to carry her to the Del?" he asks wryly.

Coda heads into Dianoga Hotel -- The Angry Rancor
Coda has left.

Arands waves his people towards the exit as the fight comes to an abrupt halt. He's a step behind Altair as she approaches the Jedi and his captive. He holsters the Kylan, approaching guardedly. This wasn't the same farmboy kid he'd seen at Yavin or even Hoth. Still, as strong as Luke seems, he keeps a slight distance from Morganna. He recognizes her now from Selene and a rush of memories ambush his mind. They are fleeting but they cause the pilot to cringe slightly.

"Yes Lt., I'm still here. Thank you for the heads up." Lando utters into the comlink, completely unaware that Delila has attempted to make ammends in anyway. As he watches the duel come to an end something else finally registers: all the New Republic military trying to get to the Tiamant. He flicks on the device once again, "Lt." he begins, "We were lucky enough to have a New Republic medical team on this cruise and they have begun taking samples. They will be leaving aboard the shuttle Tiamant. They are to be allowed to leave as the results of their tests should allow the passengers to leave."

Kelvis moves to the exit, more at a slow walk. A stalk you might say, as Altair veers off though, he goes with her, and offers, "I'll fraggin carry her, if someone helps." He mutters, to no one. Glancing at Altair, and Luke. Shouldn't he be awed? Nah, he's still angry.

You head into Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor.
Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor
This hangar is large, but not enormous. Ships landing here settle into the Angry Rancor from the large beveled opening above. It is usually open, and magnetically shielded, allowing full view of the stars beyond, and any approaching vessels. There is one large blast door which has been decorated to -not- look so much like a blast door, near the Port wall. A sign blinking over it reads, "Guest Reception and Lucky Krayt Lounge". At the fore, there is a sealed corridor with security mechanism leading to the bridge. There is another giant sized door for taking cargo down into the belly of the ship.. There is a metal cage grating over the door, suggesting that this is where live cargo is loaded and led into the holding pens below the arena. The floors here are crisp and clean, cleaner than most starships, and buffed to a dark glossy sheen. There are greeters here, amicably greeting anyone landing on the ship and handing them a booklet with information about the cruiseliner and doing anything they require to get settled in.

A large sign hangs here that says, "Welcome to The Angry Rancor. Enjoy your stay."

OOC: This ship has extensive help and guest/admin commands. Please see ARHELP for more information.

Bazil enters Main Hangar -- The Angry Rancor

Looking much like some raving, manical drunk, Bazil steps into the hangar bay, his face red, brown wet stains running down his entire front, a vest over his shoulder, a carbine blaster in one hand, and a bottle of corellian whiskey in the other. He gets several odd looks from the folks, who have by this time settled down for the most part. He sets his course directly for the Tiamant, pushing his way through, and mumbling his way past her guards.

Bazil nods emphatically, stopping just short of the ship, near Johanna, "Yeah. If the others will get their farking butts in gear." He mumbles at his sopped clothing, "Remind me never to taking another sith farking vacation ever again!"

"Hell, if one thing's for certain, it's that I'm *never* stepping off the Del again...ugh, one damn trip and the whole thing explodes," Jo remarks irately.

Altair comes stalking into the hangar bay, her anger beginning to seep out through her formerly calm exterior. "Come on, guys," she says, hitting some buttons on the Tiamant and letting the ramp slide open. "We've got a lot of work to do," she adds emphatically. A hand reaches up to rub her eyes, wondering how this could have happened with them having no clue that it was coming. Everything had seemed so peaceful yesterday. A few hours ago. And now everything was awry.

Bazil sighs. Today was one hell of a day, that's for sure. With that, he motions Johanna, "C'mon... let's go." With that, he, too, steps inside the ship.

Main Entry <Ramp> - Tiamant

        With the newer design of this ship, most of the electronics for ship functions have been reduced in size providing for a more spacious pathway to load and unload cargo, as well as having the freedom to move around for the passengers. The floor and walls are constructed of a sturdy metal compound, painted in a light gray color and using emerald green and magenta trim to give the interior a more comfortable look. Lights recessed in the ceiling above, illuminates the area.
        The entry ramp opens up into the cargo area of the ship, which has been converted to a common area. A doorway to aft leads back to the engine modules. To starboard, the bracing arm tube extends towards the cockpit and the ramp descends under the bracing arm when landed. Next to the ramp controls is a COMMPANEL.

The commpanel signals a message from the cockpit, "We're taking off folks. Next stop, Deliverance."

Bazil sighs, as he walks on up into the ship. He immediately walks over to a seat, and plops himself down in it.

Kelvis walks up the ramp, still carrying the uncoscious woman. He shakes his head, and finds a seat. He sits, still holding the woman, for some reason. He probably doesn't feel safe with just dropping her on the floor, if she comes to....

Arands enters the main entry corridor from the common area.
Arands has arrived.

Bazil yawns profusely, turning to Kelvis, barely registering that he holds the woman... but there's something about here... something he recognizes... he knows here from somewhere. But where? Too tired to think about that right now, Bazil offers to the Quarren, "Sorry about everything back at the bar, Kel... things got hectic, I freaked."

KELVIS:
The alien that stands before you, is a light grey in color. His eyes are a brilliant turquoise, which stick out against the dull background of his leathery skin. His head tapers down to what look roughly like fins on either side, but what really catches attention, are the four tentacles that hang down in front of his mouth. His height is unnoteworthy, being around the galactic average. He wears a white linen shirt, buttoned up the front. Over top of this, he wears a black vest, of a heavier fabric, and leaves it hanging open. His pants are also black, and seem to be made out of the same material. His feet are covered by a pair of black boots, giving him decent footing.

Kelvis looks at Bazil, and shrugs his shoulders, "It's okay... I wake poorly." He tries to stop a sheepish grin, "Sorry about the caf, you startled me." As the ship touches down, he starts to stand from where he perched himself, he glances up as Arands enters, and nods, he starts to turn for the ramp, interested in getting the woman to the brig, and that's about all.

Bazil stands, and slowly starts down the ramp, out into the ship... this, he's not looking forward to. How's he supposed to explain the brown stain all over him?





You depart the ship.
Auxiliary Bay -- NRSC Deliverance
        This portion of the bay has been specifically designed to house, launch and maintain the four squadrons of fightercraft assigned to the Deliverance. The central section is wide open with a high arched ceiling to allow some fighters to be moved to the upper 'storage' areas on either side of the main landing bay. To one end of the hangar is the hazy blue magnetic shield which separates the vacuum of space from the atmospherically safe interior of the ship. Halfway up the inner wall is the 'Flight Control Room', from where the flight control operators oversee the activity below. This brightly lighted bay is organically colored in deep grays, whites and greens, much like the rest of the ship.
        Starfighter technicians and utility droids are scattered throughout the hangar area. Astromech droids are in abundance, following their pilots or doing other tasks for the fighter they're assigned to. Many of the pilots are also in evidence, some congregating near the muster room while others work on their ships alongside the techs.

Kelvis walks calmly down the ramp, all his anger having bled off. He still carries Morganna. He turns to head for the lift, and the detention areas. It's not exactly his job to carry her there, but he figures he might as well. A Security officer trots up to escort him there.

Bazil stands off to the side of the ramp, and sighs, "General, do you mind if I go change real quickly? This stuff is hot." He frowns, his eyes sleepy, dropping slightly...

Arands tosses a nod in Bazil's direction. He barks an order into his comlink and four security personnel move towards Kelvis to help him with the prisoner.

Bazil(#9199POUACF)
        A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face, worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn, threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other locations. Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of it is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the edges of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas holster, in which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming softly under any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black leather, almost militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no shine, and reach nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost scoundral-like demeanor.

Operations -- NRSC Deliverance

        This room is similiarly composed of the gleaming white walls common throughout this vessel. However, its appearance differs from most of the others in two major respects. First, the room is rounded, and slopes down, providing ampitheater-like seating across three quarters of the arc. The second is the massive holoprojector unit at the base of the room, capable of rendering crucial details in a three dimensional area above it. Towards the aft of the room, near the exit archway, the library computer controls the holoprojector, as well as the trio of transparent data windows arrayed around the top of the room. The final quarter of the room is available for personnel to run briefings or hold additional equipment as needed.

Luke enteres from the open archway.
Luke has arrived.
Luke enters Operations -- NRSC Deliverance

Arands pushes his way past a guard into the Operations room's briefing area. He steps down to the table there and runs a hand through his short brown hair. Shaking his head as if awakening from a bad dream, he looks up just as Skywalker enters the room. He nods simply. "She's secured in the brig. How long I can keep a force user there, I'm not sure, Skywalker." Now Arands notices Leia, Han and Chewbacca. He nods to Han, "General... seems you've returned just in time." Another nod to Leia, "Councilor..." He gestures to both of them to take a seat. "You better sit... I don't think either of you is going to like this."

Leia, Han, and Chewbacca aren't exactly hard to miss. Ever since he and the Princess and the Wookiee Chewbacca have been hustled into the room full of tense, nervous faces, Solo has been trying his best to keep from pacing. At his flank is Chewbacca, who yorfles out a greeting to Luke even as the Corellian General's gaze shoots in the direction of the incoming arrivals. "It's about time," he says gruffly towards Arands, though he shoots Skywalker a sharply concerned glance as well. "We got here from Corellia as fast we all could."

A solemn-faced loosely-uniformed man stands next to a data terminal, tapping a message into it quickly, and reading the response. With a frown, he turns. Slim, five-foot-eleven, a dark build. A single patch lies on his uniform, with the letters NRI. He continues to stand there silently, peering between the various faces in the room quietly, without a word.

Looking more than a little drained, Luke smiles wanly at General Arands as he comes into the briefing room alongside him and glances with darkened eyes at those he already knew were present here. He gives Leia a cursory, knowing look, before approaching her and Han, speaking to Arands over his shoulder. "Just take as many precautions as you can, General. She can be held if no one gives her an opportunity to escape." Then he gives his attention solely to the Princess and Solo as his shoulders slump. "It's been a long day," he says with bitter resignation. "It seems we have another Death Star on our hands."

Kelvis enteres from the open archway.
Kelvis has arrived.
Kelvis enters Operations -- NRSC Deliverance

The well-disciplined crewman who had escorted Eva Sargent from the hangar bay nods crisply and disappears into the corridor after showing her into the ops room. She looks around, her deep eyes sharp and alert, but frosted with concern. All business, her thin short legs step further into the room with clipped steps. Her lips are pressed together in a stony but reserved frown. The junior diplomat's first destination is where the some of the senior leadership stand conferring. From their gestures and voices, they already understand the gravity of the situation. Stopping just over a meter from them, she dips in a swift plie as her bow in greeting. Her tone is sheer professionalism. "Your Highness. Generals. Luke. Have you been briefed on the situation?"

THAT bit of news slices through every conversation in the room and silence falls over all assembled. Death Star? Many of the officers here look at Luke in disbelief. Even some of those officers that had served since before Yavin. Arands can only nod at the information, his own eyes dropping to the floor. "Gastus ... is ... gone..." he says quietly.

Kelvis slips into the room. He's terribly underinformed, and terribly out of place. He didn't even have time for a change, after filing the paperwork about why Morganna was being detained. He shakes his head, and slips to a spot on the wall, trying to look as unobtrusive as possible.

The NRI officer sighs, taking the news a little better than the rest of the group. He makes his way across the room, and towards the brunt of the higher-up officials, breathing in, and out slowly, trying to relax. This won't look good on his part, nor the rest of the NRI.

Leia had not sat and had not refrained from pacing. Her fingers steepled before her coral lips, she has walked many times back and forth on the lower floor. As her brother enters, she is immediately drawn to his presence, but she doesn't move, allowing him to approach she and her husband. Luke's new is delivered like a thermal blast to her hope. "No..." She moves from fear to anger to determination within seconds. She doesn't speak of action, but her every fibre feels the need for it. At the young diplomat's approach, the Councilor shakes her head. "We're about to be. What do you know...?" She doesn't get the quesiton out before she hears Arands' news and her soul reels agains as it did when she first sensed the destruction but didn't know what it was. Grasping the back of the nearest chair for support, the strong woman shows no other signs of distress at the news for now but sets her jaw firmly as her mind searches for a response. "This must end, and quickly. Why did we have no word at all of this before now?" Her dark eyes search the room sharply for an answer.

An explosive roar bursts out of Chewbacca, shattering the horrified stillness even as Solo's eyes go hot and wild. If he weren't already on his feet, having declined Arands' suggestion to sit down, the Corellian would have shot back into a standing position. Now he reaches a hand for Leia, steadying her, bitin back the demand he's about to make with an effort as his wife makes it before him.

Feylin enteres from the open archway.

Feylin enters Operations -- NRSC Deliverance


        Average height and slight in build, Feylin is a gentle visage who tends to blend into her surroundings. Strawberry blonde hair tied in a low ponytail falls to her shoulderblades, and clear light blue eyes look intently past thick lashes. A light smattering of freckles dot her nose and the slightly rosy height of her cheeks. She wears four silvery hoops in each of her ears, and a fifth is pierced through the reddened top of the right. 

A pale blue linen shirt is tucked neatly into roughly woven, charcoal gray pants and a thin belt encircles her waist, fastening on each hip with a small silver buckle. Worn, heavy boots, dusted with sand, tie tightly around her ankles. A fragile silver necklace is clasped about her neck, and hangs only a simple piece of polished sand-jade.

The Jedi Master winces slightly at Chewbacca's jarring howl of anger, and Han moves to Leia's aid before Luke can do so. But while she and Han are full of restless energy and purpose, he finds himself weary from the experience and sits in a chair nearby, rubbing his temples. "We saw Gastus destroyed ourselves," he murmurs. "I won't know why we had no intelligence reports before. I had sensed... something. But I had no idea it was this."

Entering the Ops room quite a bit behind everyone else, Feylin is being shown in by a helpful member of the crew. She thought she was *right behind* the Jedi Master when she managed to lose track of the sentient convoy. She nods somberly to the vast group of people who she doesn't know and is looking a little uncomfortable, even for all of the things that have gone on tonight. Silently, she hurries herself to the back of the room, folding her hands and casting her glance towards the floor.

Arands shakes his head to Leia. "I have no idea, Councilor. One moment we were approaching Gastus. The next, 'IT' appeared and dispersed all of its TIEs." He looks up now as Howie enters the room. He was sure the Captain was as visibly shaken as he was at the attack. "It seemed to happen so slowly. The beam just sort of... hung there before it hit the planet. Like a dream..."

Howie apparently arrived a little later than usual, needing to speak with a few other people on the ship before entering this meeting. "I'm sorry Ladies and Gentlemen for coming here a little late, I had urgent business to attend to..." The Captain apologizes to everyone in the room as he enters, trying not to look shaken but is. He thought the nightmare in the past was over, apparently it was reawakened. "Perhaps more like a nightmare, General... now this is a handful." Perhaps that is an understatement by the Captain.

Sargent takes one step back from the group, the timing of the Wookiee's roar coinciding fortuitously with her decision to give the General the appropriate amount of room to continue the briefing. She already knows most of what Arands is saying, but defers to him as the proper person to give them the details. She stands as erect as her short stature will allow, the heel of her right food tucked neatly into the arch of her left. As she watches the alarmed reactions of those assembled, her own worried face aims to maintain control and discipline.

"We didn't know about it ahead of time," The NRI officer coughs slightly, and continues, raising his voice to cut into the conversation slowly. His voice is monotenous, meticulous, and carefully constructed... each word chosen with extreme caution. "Because we didn't know the Empire was creating another one. Our intelligence reports are still coming in from across the galaxy, and it's very sketchy so far. I'd like to give you all more information, but as of yet, I am unable to do so without causing more confusion than that which already exists." He lets out a long sigh, slowly moving his arms into a crossed pretzel, slowly kneading at his arms, dressed in some black cloth.

Bazil walks in, catching the tail end of the NRI officer's message, his face still red, but in a new set of clothes. He seems worn, and has due cause for that particular look. Droopy eyes reveal a tired man... he needs sleep, but this is important. With everything that's going on, it's doubtful he's going to be getting much sleep the next few weeks... or longer. He pauses inside the room a few feet, before working to the side, and he finally leans back against the top wall, watching the proceedings with extreme attention.

Arands moves to one side of the table now. The Captain is here and he has no desire to 'lead' this meeting. His eyes fall upon the Jedi Master, then to Han, and finally to Howie. He seems at a loss for words. Of course, of all of them, he was the only one who had witnessed the entire thing from a viewport, from beginning to end. He hadn't been able to pull his eyes from the space station or even sound an alert. If it weren't for the quick thinking of the Angry Rancor's crew, they would probably be in Imperial hands by now. "How do we combat a fully operational Death Star without intelligence. We have no plans for the station. We have no idea what new defenses it might have over its predecessors." His words are quiet and distant, as if he's reliving the memory over and over again. Not even his torture at the hands of Cimber had affected the man quite this deeply.

Kelvis blinks, and in an unguarded moment, stammers, "A DEATH Star?!" He shakes his head, eyes bugging out a bit. "How...did....THAT get past Intelligence?" Yes, that's all loud enough for anyone to hear. The Quarren is, quite simply, stunned....

The Councilor's eyes close against a wave of internal pain at Arands' description. Within, she digs deeply into her being for the strength to face the Empire's destruction yet again, finding the strength to do as she has done so many times before. Act...fight...survive against the odds. Moving to the front of the room, she approaches Arands. Unconsciously, she lays a hand on his shoulder, emitting a level of comfort to the soldier worn by trials. Having seen her own homeworld destroyed in such a way, even if she could not amplify her empathy for the man, she would feel what he feels now from her own memories. She listens to the NRI officer's report and nods with solemn accord. "Obviously, our intel is lacking. But, what matters next is that we know where the Empire may be headed with their new monster." Looking to the Junior diplomatic Representative to this system, Leia querries. "Representative Sargent...have you any contacts with the local military or their intelligence agents? And this Gastus...was it a Caspian holding?" Surely this time, the independant system they have all 'invaded' as a base for now could not expect to defend itself against this new threat without aide from the New Republic.

Bazil's reaction to Kelvis is a sigh, and his eyes close, trying to keep himself focused on this. Everything here is so chaotic. How did it happen, anyways? He'll have to find that out, unfortunately... so many lives lost on that planet. Why?

The NRI agent sighs, and shakes his head softly, obviously very embarassed about the whole situation. This isn't something to put highly on one's record. "We don't know how they managed to slip it past our agents..." The comment was more directed to Kelvis than the rest of the room.

Once Leia takes command of the briefing, Chewbacca settles down again -- but not without emitting a softer, worried whine of distress in reaction to the incoming Quarren's question, the demand that's already shot around the room and back again. "Yeah, tell me about it, Chewie, what, did we run outta Bothans?" Solo's voice has turned to a harsh gravelly rasp now, but his eyes are still heated. His stare shoots back to Leia, and like her, the General is radiating a fierce purpose.

Luckily Leia has taken charge of the meeting, and Luke can relax at last, rolling his shoulders to ease the tense ache that has settled between his shoulder blades. Haunted by what he witnessed and what he sensed, as well as the subsequent confrontation with Morganna, Luke listens to the flurry around him, then blinks as he sees Feylin alone at the back of the room. He motions for her to come over as he adds to the debate going on, "It's no use worrying about what we didn't do. Now we must focus on how to face this threat. We've all been resting on our laurels too long, and the Empire -- and the Sith -- have grown stronger because of it."

The Captain of this ship seems oddly quiet, gently leaning against the projection device as he tries to think throughout this chaos. "Alright everyone... first thing's first. We all need to try to calm down a bit... heck I'm not sure how to do that since I'm still very stunned by what has just occured but if we're to get through this, we'll need clear heads." He then nods to Luke as he is in agreement with the Jedi, "Thank you Master Skywalker." With that stated, Darklighter looks around the room at the various people from council member to old heroes to the New Republic staff. "Alright... first, we'll have to assume that the Imperials did an excellent job hiding this new weapon of destruction from everyone, including their own people. I know your people tried your hardest, thank you." The Captain nods to the NRI officer at hand, atleast he doesn't have to feel any worse since it wasn't his fault, lets not kill the messenger. "But we'll need everything that Intel has on this new weapon or anything that is related to it. Another thing, Master Skywalker, I know this doesn't exactly link to the Imperial weapon but... I have heard that we have a captive onboard, yes?"

As Intelligence's lack of knowledge about the weapon becomes apparent, Sargent's alarm grows. While the Death Star was at Gastus, more of the Imperial fleet could have been anywhere. She recalls with disappointment how many New republic personnel were on the Angry Rancor. Officers, pilots, herself included. They were so unprepared. Thankfully, the problem was not compounded by a two-front attack. She steps forward again, taking a deep breath to focus on her answer to the Councilor. "Yes. I have developed connections with several CDU military officers, and I have informed President Laarken about the attack. To the best of my knowledge, Gastus was not a CDU world." The use of the past tense is painfully accurate. If it had been a CDU holding, the attack could have made a strong arguement for potential alliance.

Arands relaxes somewhat as Leia eases some of the pain of the memories. As she takes control of the meeting, Arands reaches up and rubs his eyes as the finger-pointing begins. He shakes his head but says nothing. As Luke speaks up, he begins to agree with the man ... until his remark about 'resting on our laurels'. This prompts a glare from the pilot as a surge of anger rushes to the surface. How dare he ... and just as quickly the anger subsides. No, the Jedi Master was right. They may have been on the offensive lately, but Luke was speaking of the NR as a whole. And with that assessment of the state of the NR, he couldn't disagree.

A soft beep ushers forth from the NRI officer's terminal. He blinks, and turns, heading back over to it with deliberate ease. He doesn't even bother to respond to the thanks his group got... tapping the terminal back to life, he reads over the latest message solemly, without a word. He continues to stand there, reading through whatever it is that's there, before tapping the terminal closed, and returning to the group slowly. He seems a bit more embarassed now... even with all his restraints, he can't keep something like that hidden forever.

The quiet, observing young woman nods slowly as Luke beckons her towards him, and with several steps, Feylin stands behind the Jedi Master, and a tad offcenter. She places a comforting hand on his shoulder for just a moment, offering a breif squeeze before the fingers fall back to clasp at her waist. No vocal interjection is offered, but the hollow, haunted look in her eyes proves that she too was witness to the evening's charades. Not the first time she's witnessed destruction at the hand of the Empire, but truth be told, the most agonizing.

Kelvis blinks a bit, and makes another statement, this one a bit more calculated, and being the only alien here, other then the Wookiee, it could be because of his mind, "Are we even sure that the Imperials built it?" He asks, after all, this could be the first chord of a new enemy.

Glancing tiredly over his shoulder at Feylin, Luke smiles his appreciation to her before he stands and takes a few steps toward the Captain. "Yes, and if we're wise, we'll take advantage of having Moff Tazecks in our custody." As whispers move through the room, exploring other possibilities and doubting the Empire's involvement, Luke shakes his head. "No, it was Emperor Valak. I sensed his presence on board that battle station -- that's why he sent the TIEs after us," he admits lowly.

"And we have other proof, more or less. A half dozen of our best undercover operatives have gone missing... from Imperial territory. They're trying to cover /something/ up..." The NRI officer adds to Luke's statements. Obviously what the terminal had to say.

"Thank you, Eva," Leia nods to the young woman. With her calm accord, the Princess scans the room again, nodding to the Captain in agreement. "Yes, we can't spend time kicking ourselves over what we've missed, but must grow more agressive in finding out what we need. Imperials have always been able to be bought. We've proved this numerous times." The Councilor's dark eyes meet those of the Jedi Master, and the Corellian General one at a time while she continues to keep near General Arands, a bond growing between them, though no time exists now for sorrows. "We must have plans and soon." She now regards everyone within her sight with a slow sweep of the room. "We can't allow Valak to use his new toy again if we can help it. All of our member worlds need to know of this threat." She seems almost to be working out the situation aloud, yet she speaks with purpose. "We must secure our borders, vast as they've become. We can't possibly offer individual protections. Our members have grown faster than our resources."

Kelvis blinks, then nods his head. Well, that cinches that it's the Imperials, and agents turning up missing.... he mutters, probably so only those at the back can hear, "Intel really dropped the ball on this one... those missing agents should have set off bells." He shakes his head, settling in to listen, jaw set in a scowl now.

"Lets not try to blame ourselves for anything that links to this event... what has happened happened, we can't change the past but we can shape the future and we have to focus on that." The Captain quickly replies, wanting everyone to atleast have a spirit to fight for now. "What I'm worried about right now, Master Skywalker, isn't how we're going to manipulate Moff Tazecks but instead, how safe this vessel will be. Being the Captain of this vessel, I must ensure the safety of my crew and the people that are currently onboard, which includes everyone here. I want to know how... safe this ship is from Moff Tazecks. Is there anything extra we need to do to maintain ship security?" He then nods to the Princess as she speaks of plans, "And to make the plans... we'll need fresh information." With that said, he turns to the NRI representitive, "Will you be our liason for the time being, so we can work together as well as the new information streams in?" The question is somewhat rhetorical, allowing the NRI officer to 'make up' for Intel's lack of knowledge of the weapon.

TIE fighters, shooting at Luke. A Moff captured -- and Morganna, too, apparently. And a planet destroyed, most of all. No wonder the Kid couldn't tell him and Leia and Chewie sooner what had been going on, huh? Chewbacca is trying not to roar again, but the Wookiee is almost vibrating with the apparent desire to rip something in half, and as Leia asserts the need to make plans, he chimes in with a decisive, "We secure our territory, then we go in and we blow the thing up. We've done it twice before and we'll do it again. I don't see too much in the way o' complicated here, people." A crooked grin that might seem a bit inappropriate considering the gravity of the situation skews his mouth -- but it's not exactly an expression of levity, not given the almost feral spark in his hazel eyes. Indeed, Han looks almost... hungry. "I'm not commanding the army any more. But I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit on my hands."

"Of course, captain. I'll be at your disposal for as long as you need me. We already have agents running errands right now, trying to piece together what exactly happened tonight. Hopefully, we can re-infiltrate the Imperial infrastructure by tomorrow evening... or at worst, the week's end. We /will/ get your information." The officer replies sternly, resolving his entire group to the utmost level of work. It may take time, but they'll get that information...

He has fallen silent now. Watching as those gathered speak. At Solo's words, Arands jerks upright. "No offense, General, but if Valak is playing with his toy, he's pretty sure we can't touch it." He nods his head to the heroes of the Rebellion with some respect. "But let's be realistic. The battle at Yavin nearly cost us all of our available resources. Without Master Skywalker, the Rebellion would've all but been crushed." The StarOps general looks to Luke for a fleeting moment. If he only knew how jealous Arands had been when Luke had returned victorious. Without a fighter, Arands had no way to join in the battle. "Endor was a victory against a partially completed Death Star." He pauses for a few moments, then looks at Solo squarely. "This is a fully operational Death Star ... and Valak has to have learned from Palpatine's mistakes."

"Perhaps," Luke muses, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, "You should consider keeping the Moff sedated until she can be transferred to a maximum security facility. I'm sure she's knowledgeable about the Death Star." He clears his throat, refraining from volunteering for that job himself. He approaches Leia as Han gives his two credits' worth, and grins in his direction. "Last time we had the plans to work off of," he reminds the Corellian. "We don't have anything this time." The Jedi places a hand on Leia's shoulder, briefly sharing his concern and sense of weariness. "I'm going to go rest, and check on Artoo. Someone brief me if we find out anything else." Turning, Luke paces across the briefing room, pausing by Feylin to whisper to her before he makes his way to the exit.

Sargent chides herself again. She had been totally oblivious of the first Death Star, and totally powerless to do anything against the second. And now this. It must stop here. After they flash, she stubbornly pushes such feelings far from her mind. Just one step above insignifigant in the scheme of things, she is here to do whatever she can. With the Councilor's urging to make plans, she is all ears. General Solo's words are a definite encouragement. A fresh gleam breezes like oxygen to a flame, and Eva Sargent stands up even straighter than she was before, if that is at all possible. But the flame is dimmed in accord with Arands' assessment. She knows all too well how the Empire operates.

The tension in the room is appropriately thick, and all Feylin can find to do with herself is stand rigidly, arms folded protectively across her chest. She bows her head to listen as Luke murmurs to her. She nods, looking up to those with enough importance and holding in the galaxy to be gathered. She nods her silent reverence before casting her gaze again to the ground as she strides purpousfully to the exit.

Kelvis shakes his head, as the middle aged Quarren is at a loss for words. He was in Tech school for the first Death Star, and it was hardly even a blip on his sensor screen. The second one, he was more cognizent of, but he was working in the private sector, and well away from anything to deal with it. And now, a third one. The one thought that has suddenly come into his mind, 'Why did I join the New Republic Armed Forces again?' And he suddenly can't shake it.

Bazil frowns softly, still in the back of the room... he stiffles a large yawn, and pushes himself upright. It's time to sleep. It has definately been a very long night... he turns, and steps out the door swiftly.
