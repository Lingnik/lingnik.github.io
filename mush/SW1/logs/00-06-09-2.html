<p>==LOG BEGINS==</p>
<p>LOCATION: Corellia: Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor slowly slips onto the track just inches from the starting gate. The pilot
begins running through the systems checklists, giving a thumbs-up to his teammate.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark follows out on the Repossessor's tail, her pilot offering a free hand to
give a mock-salute to the other. She moves into position at the gate, and her pilot follows suit with the checklists.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon is already lined up for the first race. The balck and crimson colors of Team
Corellia line several sections of the track and the crowd noise from these sections is exceptionally loud as the fans
get to see the Grade 4 competitor race on the first night of the tournament.</p>
<p>"La-dies and gen-tle-be-ings," the announcer drawls out dramatically as the speakers of the track come to life, echoing
his voice throughout the expansive stadium. "Welcome to the Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena! Tonight, daredevil pilots will
brave the dangerous journey from start to finish in competition to the DEATH for some of the galactic racing circuit's
largest prizes! Starting things off, we have Joshua Arands, Team Corellia's racer on the Event Horizon, in the Grade 4
division! Two steps down in the Grade 2 stakes is Kestryan du Bracc, racing the KIF Repossessor for Team KIF! His
teammate, Mege Vauki, is racing in the Grade 1 division on the KIF Loanshark." A few other names no one's ever heard of
pop up as the racers begin to line up in the starting gates, then as the last one locks and loads, the light goes green
and a shrill buzzer sounds, accompanying the opening of the gates and the unleashing of the swoops out on the track.
"And they're off!"</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon revs up from a throaty growl to a powerful roar as the announcer speaks and
the lights start their cycle to green. Aboard the Event Horizon, Arands braces to be released from the starting gate.
When the light flashes green and the swoops are released, the Event is already thundering down tube 3.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon skims across the turbulent waters at an impressive speed. A bit of one wave
leaps high enough to splash against a maneuvering vane, but it only slows the swoop down a little.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark revs plentifully as the lights cycle into green. Her pilot flips the visor
on his helmet down, leaning further down on the beast. As the green light flickers on, the swoop screams off from the
gates into tube one, her pilot shifting the swoop into full gear.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark glides with ease over the sand, the wave water untouching. The pilot she
bears relaxes slightly, keeping the swoop at her decent pace until it successfully strikes out of the section.
Unscathed, and unbroken, her pilot breathes a heavy sigh unheard and unseen...</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor hovers behind the starting gate, the pilot twisting the throttles slowly
to cycle fuel through the engine, ultimately warming it up. As the announcer finishes, he slides the visor down on his
helmet and leans forward a bit, experience taking over. As the green light flashes, the swoop lunges forward in a fit of
speed...at full thrust toward tube 3.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor darts easily above the waves, dodging several that spray salty brine upon
the swoop's landing pads. The driver slides into the next section, waving quickly to his teammate as he passes by.</p>
<p>As the swoops pass into section 2, the scoreboard illuminates and designates the racers each in their respective
positions for their respective divisions. In the Grade 4 division, Joshua Arands from Team Corellia on the Event Horizon
is marked at 62 SRU's, while the two Team KIF racers are listed behind him, Kestryan du Bracc on the KIF Repossessor has
34 SRU's, and Mege Vauki on the KIF LoneShark has 22 SRU's. The sandy dunes of Corellia's Coronet Beaches fades out to
the dense forests of Kashyyyk as the crowds roar with vicious glee, some happy the racers have done well so far, the
others begging at the tops of their lungs for a disasterous turn of events.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon pulls out in front of the rest of the swoops, which gives the pilot room to
work with as he prepares to delve into the serpentine path. Keeping his body low to the chassis, Arands keeps the speed
up and uses his body weight to twist into the first turn of tube 3.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark drags behind the leaders, and reduces speed slightly. Her rider is
inexperienced and on an unmodified swoop, but he pushes the swoop forward at the mediocre pace, taking her through her
paces, and into tube two. He holds onto the ride, hoping for the best, as he pushes inside...</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark glides through the forest easily, making his way through the branches,
vines, trees, and everything else that manages to decide to pop up with relative ease; albeit, without covering much
ground very quickly. As she nears the edge of the forest, her pilot coaxes her out of his second successful section of
track.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor heads into the forest and immediately is ducking branches and twisting the
swoop through the trees, obviously not quite prepared for the suddenness of the course. And Wookies like this stuff? The
driver's concentration seems unbreakable as he points the swoop into tube 3 at full thrust.</p>
<p>WOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor , through divine intervention or perhaps just great piloting skills,
swerves through the trees, losing only a little momentum as the pilot pulls back and to the right while avoiding a tree
stump. With the engine whining softly, the swoop enters section 3.</p>
<p>When each of the competitors cross the invisible marker between sections 2 and 3, an electronic speed registers and adds
to their total to mark the full distance run. In the Grade 4 division, Joshua Arands from Team Corellia on the Event
Horizon is marked at 130 SRU's, while the two Team KIF racers are listed behind him, Kestryan du Bracc on the KIF
Repossessor has 62 SRU's, and Mege Vauki on the KIF LoneShark has 39 SRU's. Thick forests begin to give way to an urban
cityscape as the single tube sends racers straight for an open ravine over Tibannopolis.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon roars forward at its best speed. As the woop nears the repulsor pads, the
driver rises slightly in his seat, almost standing on the foot pegs. This has worked every other time. Let's hope it
works this time. Keeping the throttle in over, the Event approaches the repulsorpad.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon hits the sweet spot on the pad once against and the crimson and black swoop
sails up and onto the the edge of tube 3. The swoop is throttled down while airborn and as the swoop nears its landing
point, it takes off at great speed with a gutteral roar.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark grunts through into the third section, her pilot gunning the engines into
full overdrive. He, unlike the Grade 4, has no experience with this sort of thing, and just leans down onto his swoop
further, throttling the engines to the max.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark enters into the threshold of the repulser pad, darting off of it and sailing
towards the lowest platform. Her pilot rises off the seat slightly, and as the vehicle drops onto the landing area, he
guns the swoop forth again.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor plummets toward the ramp at breakneck speed. The pilot, oblivious to any
life-threatening risk, kicks the swoop into overdrive trying to make up some lost speed. As the swoop shoots off of the
ramp, the pilot attempts to keep as little surface area as possible at the wind, as it would slow down the craft.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor dips slowly, losing altitude but keeping the momentum. The pilot error
causes the swoop to plop down onto the lower platform, but gives the pilot enough time to compensate, shift, and bring
the swoop into line for the next section.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon jukes left then right as the driver positions for the best approach to tube
3 of the Coral Reef section. Finally aligned, the swoop slips intot he craggy reefs at top speed.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon breaks free of the reefs with a quick thumbs up to the large group of Team
Corellia fans overlooking this section of the track. He's quick to retake control of the swoop and continue his
full-speed assault of this course.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark floats into the watery areas, her pilot revving the engines, and setting
course for tube one, and open waters. As he approaches it, he guns the swoop into overdrive, trusting fate to the winds,
and lowering himself down atop the vehicle to decrease drag.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark flits carefully across the waters, speeding along. The waters under his
vessel ripple and wake from the draft caused from the swoop's speed, a bit of water splashing up onto the very back of
it, without much hinderance to her. Her pilot remains fixed on the top of the vehicle as he departs yet another
successful section of track.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor bobbs and weaves among the extra-large coral. The pilot shifts back down
to full thrust, gaining more control over the swoop through the turns.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor maneuvers through the intertwining organic reef. Near the exit, the pilot
is quick to duck beneath a coral arch, before raising the swoop to gain altitude and fly over a falling chunk of
biologic material.</p>
<p>As each racer crosses the invisible marker between sections 4 and 5, an electronic speed registers and adds to their
total.  Joshua Arands on the Event Horizon is clocked at 277 SRU's for the Grade 4 division, Kestryan du Bracc on the
KIF Repossessor is running at a speed of 132 SRU's in Grade 2, And Mege Vauki is clocked on the KIF LoneShark at 100
SRU's for Grade 1, with an amazing gain in speed. The water begins to steam as the swoops speed into the hot, molten
environment that is home to the RASA track's dangerous and deadly Laval Dragon.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon seems to gain a little speed going into this section as the cooler breezes
from the last section help cool down the engines a bit. Arands seems to 'eye' the dragon as the Event Horizon closes the
gap.  Without hesitation, the Tralusian driver keeps the throttle wide open and shoots for the third tube.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon skims through the volcanoes themselves with no problem. He seesm to be clear
of the entire section when the swoop jerks underneath him and slows. Seems the lava dragon tagged the swoop just enough
to slow it down. Hopefully a warning to the riders behind that the dragon is a bit tired of missing the pests that keep
buzzing its habitat.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark slashes into the lava-filled area, her pilot faltering for a solitary moment
at the sudden influx of molten rock. He makes a quick decision, pushing the swoop into the first tube, reducing speed a
small bit to her normal full speed. A small collection of boos usher forth from the crowd at the relatively new pilot's
choice.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark gracefully drifts around the lava, taking the shallow turns carefully in the
reduced speed. Luckily, however, she seems to make it through unscathed and intact. The crowds vent, continuing to boo
at him as he clears that leg of the race.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor slides left and right nearing the 3 tubes. The pilot, unsure if he wants
to take on the beast or not, pulls out a small blaster from his boot. Not that it would do any good. Deciding that one
lava monster is much better than an Imperial fleet or Death Star, the pilot sucks up his courage and heads into tube 3
at full thrust.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor skims over the lava pool, the heat rising in nearly-invisible, shimmering
clouds of vapor. The pilot, undaunted by the growing heat and the red light indicating that the engine was getting too
warm, presses on...only to find a large Lava Dragon in his path. He looks at the dragon, then the blaster, then the
dragon...and tucks the blaster into his boot. No need to make it mad. The Dragon reaches out for the Repo, but instead
swipes a slower, more unlucky, swoop driver right off of the saddle.</p>
<p>As each racer crosses the invisible marker between sections 5 and 6, some narrowly missing becoming the lunch of a Lava
Dragon, an electronic speed registers and adds to their total. Joshua Arands on the Event Horizon is clocked at 337
SRU's for the Grade 4 division, Kestryan du Bracc on the KIF Repossessor is running at a speed of 172 SRU's in Grade 2,
And Mege Vauki is clocked on the KIF LoneShark at 118 SRU's for Grade 1, with an amazing gain in speed. The heat doesn't
dissipate as the lava is left behind in favor for the hot sands of Tatooine's Beggar's Canyon- Section Six.</p>
<p>Another canyon and a chance to let the Event Horizon's engines cool a bit from the heat of the Iron Tower. Arands dodges
into the canyon entrance and keeps the throttle wide open.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon careens through the canyon but catches a bit of a sidewind, causing the
Grade 4 swoop to fight a bit to make headway. The Event emerges at the other end of the canyon in good form, leading
well ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark lugs into the canyon, and the appearance of his homeworld makes Mege grin
with glee. This is definately familitar territory to him, so he guns the engines into overdrive, letting them scream
forth. The heat, for one thing, is a relief to both pilot and swoop from the lava's heat in the previous section.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark easily slashes through each corner, the pilot well accostomed to this
terrain. A few mis-created walls throw him off partially, but he keeps his speed high, running the ship as fast as
possible through each turn and curve of the canyon. As show, he even buzzes a canyon wall carefully; whether on purpose
or accident is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor begins to cool down only slightly as it enters the hot, sunlit track of
the Beggar's Canyon. The dunes whoosh past, some of the sand blowing off of the tops in the wake of the machines. Given
a new feeling of self-confidence, the driver thrusts forward into overdrive as he skims over the sea of sand into the
canyon.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor winds through the canyon, hopping up to avoid scurrying wamprats and other
scaley critters. About half-way through the canyon course, smoke from a pair of wrecked speeders covers the track,
making it difficult to see. The pilot goes in high, avoiding the crashed swoops and getting enough distance above the
surface to be able to just barely see through to the other side. Today is his day.</p>
<p>As each racer crosses the invisible marker between sections 6 and 7, coasting across the relatively clear canyon floor,
an electronic speed registers and adds to their total. Joshua Arands on the Event Horizon is clocked at 402 SRU's for
the Grade 4 division, Kestryan du Bracc on the KIF Repossessor is running at a speed of 216 SRU's in Grade 2, And Mege
Vauki is clocked on the KIF LoneShark at 148 SRU's for Grade 1. Only now does the heat begin to fade away as a frigid
chill fills the air. The swoops embark into frozen terrain- section seven, the glacier fields of Hoth. Howls of the live
Wampa in the third tube echo menacingly.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon cruises past another fan seating section between sections 6 and 7. This
time, the crowd noise from the Team Corellia fans isn't quite as loud, but it's still there. Arands settles into the
saddle of the swoop a little bit and lowers his body over the chassis some. He'd played with Wampas before he ever
started racing swoops and he's betting even odds that these are hardly as dangerous as the ones he flew over on the real
Hoth. He stays on course for the dark narrow, windy tunnel with the throttle wide open. (tube 3)</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon dodges easily through the tunnels and Arands has to turn his head to catch
sight of one of the wampas down here. Seems they were sleeping or not expecting company, but the only one who is close
is too small to reach the Event Horizon as it screams through the tunnels.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark screeches into the freezing weather of Hoth, the cold already reducing the
heat from the engines from it's previous two trips. With determination, she shoots forward at a slightly slower pace.
Her pilot guns at the throttle, but the cold keeps it at less than best, at a mediocre full speed. With the latest
revelation that the swoop doesn't like cold, her rider pushes the swoop into the first tube. The crowd, of course, is
less than pleased at this rookiee's choice.</p>
<p>With a definate lack of speed from the previous encounteres, the LoanShark lumbers over the easy passage of snow and ice
beneath. He dodges a couple of small rodents that stand firmly in his path, before continuing on, and out of the
cold-stuck lands.</p>
<p>Live wampa, or no live wampa, the pilot of the KIF Repossessor appears to care not. He does, however, slow the swoop
down to full throttle, still trying to maintain his speed as he heads into tube 3 and the possible clutches of a hairy,
stinking flesh-eater.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor whips around several corners before coming face to face with the Wampa.
From the charred debris and the arm hanging from the Wampa's mouth, one can tell that someone wasn't very lucky.
Cringing a bit in disgust, the pilot easily dodges a few annoyed swipes from a hairy paw, before continuing on course
and into the next section.</p>
<p>As each racer enters the very final section of the race, the dangerous and deadly sewers of Anoat with the Dianoga in
the most challenging section, an electronic speed registers and adds to their total. Joshua Arands on the Event Horizon
is clocked at 470 SRU's for the Grade 4 division, Kestryan du Bracc on the KIF Repossessor is running at a speed of 252
SRU's in Grade 2, And Mege Vauki is clocked on the KIF LoneShark at 164 SRU's for Grade 1. The finish line is in sight-
who will brave the shortcut and the hungry Dianoga?</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon doesn't slow a bit as it heads for the narrow tunnel into the compactor. The
swoop roars in with the driver feathers the controls for a better alignment.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Event Horizon crosses the finish line well ahead of the pack but the way the driver's head
hangs makes it clear that this score was nothing to be proud of. It's probably a good thing that Arands is a better
pilot than he is swoop driver. Well, good for the New Republic - bad for the Empire.</p>
<p>Mege doesn't care much for the thought of death within the grasps of such a beast, and instead careens into tube one.
The pilot's decision draws more boos, but he guns the swoop -- HARD, throwing himself as compacted to the vehicle as
humanly possible, trying his best to rip the throttle off, from the looks of it, as he contorts it to it's maximum
threshold. As a last leg, he wants to get as much as he can out of it...</p>
<p>With relative ease, Mege passes through the final tube -- one even a rookiee like him could take. But, luckily, the
grinding at the throttle seems to boost a bit more out of her engines, and she shoots forth, at a speed he is rather
appreciative.  Finally, he drops over the finish line, grinning widely as he brakes the vehicle. Freeing a hand, he
lifts the visor to his helmet, giving full view of his appreciative smile. Luck shone brightly on this man today, that's
for sure.</p>
<p>SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF Repossessor enters the shortcut, the pilot taking a terrible risk with the
always-dangerous Dianoga. With a sudden burst of speed, the swoop rushes toward the awaiting maw of the beast. The
throttle is set at full as the swoop enters tube 2.</p>
<p>With the battle cry of a drunken midshipman, the pilot of the KIF Repossessor shoots between the tentacles of the
Dianoga. At one point, the man pulls out his blaster and fires two timed shots into one tentacle that was getting just a
bit too close for comfort. With the wind at his back (and that horrid creature), the swoop crosses the finishline in a
blinding burst of speed. As the race ends and the crowds cheer and jeer, Kest removes his helmet and gives another
victorious cry. He proved something today, he's sure of it.</p>
<p>"And there's the finish!" the announcer bellows jubilantly as the swoops cross the checkered line. "Joshua Arands has
set a pace time for the Grade 4 division with 567 SRU's. Kestryan Du Bracc has established a time to beat of 321 for
Grade 2, and Mage Vauki has set a pace time of 199 SRU's for the Grade 1 racers to compete against. How will these
scores hold up over the course of the tournament? You'll have to stick around to find out!"</p>
<p>A pause, then, "We'd like to thank our sponsors this evening.. CEC Shipyards, Rendili Stardrives, Subpro Shipyards,
Avalon Enterprises, Nappa's Creations incorporated, Fineline Spaceways, McTavish Enterprises, Indigo Entertainment, and
the Black Krayt arena. Without these wonderful sponsors, whose advertisements are on display in our main mezzanine,
these races would not be possible."</p>
