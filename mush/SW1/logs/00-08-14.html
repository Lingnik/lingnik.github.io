Players Involved: Lelila, Vek, Bazil, Altair

==LOG BEGINS==

Lelila hops out of her A-Wing, after the practice run, and before anyone
can object she heads out the hangar. When she comes back, the bay is
remarkably empty- only a few techs and a few pilots remain. Coming back
she heads back over to her ship and talks to a few techs about it's
condition. Coming to a agreement she prepares to leave again but she stops
short seeing Vek, she waves before walking over a tired smile on her face.

"Maker have mercy!" the pilot of Ghost 9 calls out across the hangar.
Breaking into a run, he darts across the hangar and envelopes the woman's
smaller form in a hug. Holder her back at arms' length, he studies her,
hoping he hasn't scared her and breaks into a hearty chuckle. "I'm so
sorry I didn't let you know where I was going, Lel," he apologizes, the
myrth disappearing from his voice. "I had some unexpected business to
attend to and couldn't get back till today." Removing one hand from her
shoulder, Vek moves it through sweat-streaked hair and smiles again. "It's
good to see you again, Lel."

        A calm night, aye. Too calm, almost, as footsteps clamp-clamp
against the floor of the bay, the source coming from behind several larger
shuttles. The only other foot traffic, besides the technicians and sparse
pilots, are the droids who carefully dart here and there; mostly
navigation, trash, and whatnot, they clamber here and there mindlessly.
Suddenly, the clamp-clamping stops, and a head pokes out from behind one
of the shuttles. Bazil, with his hair slicked back wickedly, trussed all
up in some sort of sheet with a belt. The sheet, as it is, seems to be a
deep crimson blue in color, with no design on it. His eyes shift around
the bay, as if looking for something, before he slowly creeps out from
behind the shuttle. At his side, is mounted a long sword, kept in place by
his belt. Out of seemingly nowhere, he pulls the blade out from his belt,
and holds it two-handed, looking around calmly. A comical sight, this
would be, if it weren't for the wicked blade in his hands.

Lelila smiles and returns the hug, she had missed him...oddly. But it
hadn't occured to her that he had left for any period of time, just
thought he had gotten caught up in the Del, maybe spending time with
Dayna. "Good to see you too, it's been quite around here without you
stirring up trouble." She winks, and begins to say something else when the
figure of someone catches her glance. She has to blink twice as she
murmers, "What the far is he doing?"

Grinning at her comment, Vek's demeanor is quite different than the
emptiness in the pit of his stomach would indicate.  Turning about, he
notices something odd--McKenzie, dressed in a sheet, wielding a rather
wicked sword. While he is not certain how well the man knows how to use
the thing, Eldar is smart enough to know to keep his distance. Looking
back at her, his hand still on her shoulder, the pilot shakes his head,
saying, "I have no idea." The man was prone to odd behavior it seemed, but
this was the most bizarre to date.

        And the odd behaviour continues, as well. Bazil slowly creeps
about the deck, peering under ships, around droids, and everything else as
he searches for... whatever it is he's searching for. He seems almost not
to notice the other people in the bay... most of which have either not
seen him, or given him an odd look and stayed quite a ways away.  
Clank-clank-clank come the footsteps of a golden protocol droid, who
marches in the general direction of the sword-wielding sheet-bearer. As
Bazil spots the droid, he rushes over, and quickly inquires to it: "Where
did he go?"
        Obviously confused, the protocol replies, "Oh my... where did who
go, sir?"
        "The other man! The one who was carrying a weapon like this," he
lifts the sword up in display, "Only a beam with a maroon color... where
is he? I saw him run in here!"
        "Oh dear... I don't believe I've seen anyone matching that
description... perhaps if you take the matter up with ship security, they
might be able to assist you?" The droid wobbles back and forth, as it
looks 'nervously' at the nut.
        Cursing slightly to himself, Bazil glares at the droid, "Fark!
Away with you, and tell the Moff that I will have his head after I finish
off this accursed Sith!"
        "Oh dear oh dear... Moff? Sith?" The droid proffers, before Bazil
shoos him off, and continues on his search.

Lelila stands back quietly next to Vek, watching this very...odd exchange
beteen Bazil and the droid. After he saunters off she leans over to Vek
and frowns, "I think that he has finally lost it..." She is tempted to go
over to Bazil and talk to him but her eyes are on his sword which she has
a feeling he thinks is a saber...oh my.

Nodding to the woman, Vek's gaze is locked on the man and his 'saber,'
darting about the shuttles in the hangar, hoping that the droid is not
mistaken for a stormtrooper. The pilot feels an urge to call out to the
man, but suppresses it and looks back at Lelila. "What do we do?" he asks
her quietly, hoping that she will have some idea how to resolve this
situation.

Lelila blinks and shakes her head, the last time she had seen him he had
seen normal...now he was thinking he was a Jedi or something, or so it
seemed. She whispers back pointing, "I don't know, he might think one of
us is this Sith of his or something."

        And in a single moment, Bazil's face turns to face Lelila, a beam
of recognition and utter delight gracing his face, "Traxari!" He darts for
her, Vek's body partially concealed behind a fighter, which keeps his face
from Bazil's view.  "Traxari, my apprentice... where have you been? Did
you deactivate the shields?" And then, as he arrives on the scene, Vek
comes into his vision. A moment is shared there where Bazil simply stares
at the young man, before his face turns to anger and hatred, as if Vek
were something he had loathed for so long, now in front of him for the
slaying. "You..." comes the simple world, as the eyes that mark Bazil's
face squint, and he raises the sword slowly in front of him, moving a
solitary foot back in a battle-ready stance, "Draw your weapon... and
fight me, you coward. I have waited too long for this moment.  Join /me/
and the light side, and together, we will free the universe of it's
bondage from the Empire." A solitary hand drops from his sword, and he
proffers the hand to Vek, as if to shake his, the sheet-robe on his body
loosely drifting around his feet.

Eyes widening as the man rushes to them, he casts a glance at Lelila, or
Traxari, rather, and then looks back at the 'Jedi.' Not wishing a
confrontation with the armed man, Eldar does what he assumes to be the
smart thing and reaches for the man's extended hand. "I...I accept your
proposal, Master Jedi. I feel that you can steer me back onto the path to
enlightenment."  Swallowing, he looks back at Lelila and then to the
Master. "I can see now the error of my ways, and wish for your guidance,
and that of your apprentice," he adds.

Lelila blinks and bites her lip, ether she wants to keep from laughing or
staring, okay she'll go with Vek's plan and just...play along. "Oh yes
Master, though I was distracted, but even that did not get in my way..."
She too swallows hard and looks toward Vek a frown coming to her face,
"What should we do with him, Master, now that he has surren...er seen his
ways?" Her last glance to for any help around the hangar bay, but any
techs or other pilots are just watching in amusement.

        Your apprentice. The simple two words seem to stick in his head
for far too long... but he accepts the hand, and smiles brightly, "You
have chosen wisely, young one. Together, we will reestablish the Jedi
order, and bring peace to the galaxy, and..." He stops short, in the
middle of his sentence, his eyes growing slightly narrow again. He rips
his hand from Vek's, and backs away immediately, peering at the two with
supreme suspiciousness. His battle-stance is regained, and he growls, "You
two were in league the entire time... Traxari... you sithspawn. I should
have known better then to trust a /Corellian/... very well. You will die
together, for your servitude to the /dark side/..." His emphasis lies on
the final sentence, especially the last two words. On the outside, he
/seems/ to be completely serious. And, with a sword like that in his
clutches, it would be an obvious mistake to cross him. Nonetheless, he
backs away more, taking in a harsh battle-ready stance.

Taking a step back and pulling the woman standing next to him back with
him, Vek shakes his head. "It's not what you think, Master Jedi," he
explains, placing as much seriousness in his tone as he can muster. The
pilot ponders calling for security or reaching for his blaster, but given
that the man seems to have suffered some kind of mental duress, does not
do so. "Your apprentice found me and had me cornered--she wouldn't leave
until your arrival. I can understand why she wouldn't want an apprentice
of the dark arts lurking about, Master." What else could he do, truly?

Lelila has a really hard time keep a straight face at the Corellian
remark, but instead she turns her glance back to Vek and nods at his
statement, "What he says is true Master, I was defenseless, and you kniw
is it not my way to fight, so I had to wait for you...please forgive me,
my Master if I appeared another way." She bows her head, and brings out a
look of sadness.  Before lifting up and pointing her gaze straight as
Bazil, she wasn't sure how long they could keep this up.

        For a moment there, a brief moment, Bazil starts to believe his
apprentice and the Sith. But, the moment ends, as oddly concocted
memories, created by his own mind, begin to resurface. Images flash
through his mind... created half from real events, and his own
imagination. Death, destruction. It would end. Here. Now. In this very
bay. Bazil would remove another sith, and potential dark side turner.
There would be no regrets this time. "I don't believe you... I don't
believe any of it!" He screams aloud, closing his eyes to the auxillary
bay, more images flashing through his mind. His head turns skywards, and
he utters a sharp, piercing scream. What little sanity left in him escapes
for a brief fleeting moment, and he drops to his knees, the sword
clattering loudly to the harsh flooring, the screeches from his mouth
continuing. Suddenly, silence. A beat. His mouth closes, he brings both
hands up to his head, holding it there, the eyes now masked by brown hair
which has escaped it's bonds, covering his face. The head turns up
slightly, letting all view pain and utter distraught, as if someone was
stabbing at his very soul with a lightsaber. He gasps loudly, falling over
onto the ground with a 'thump' and stays there, breathing heavily, his
eyes closed, seeming to be unconscious, were it not for his fingers
twitching every now and then.

Watching the man slump to the ground, Vek looks quickly at Lelila and then
at McKenzie and decides to take the initiative.  Rushing to the man's
side, he reaches for the man's wrist and briefly takes a pulse. "His
heartbeat is racing, Lel," he says, voice quiet, filled with seriousness.
"McKenzie...McKenzie," he whipsers softly to the man. Looking at the
woman, his gaze seems to plead for her to help him. Unsure what to do in
this situation, Vek simply lays a hand on the man's shoulder, continuing
to lock gazes with Lelila.

Lelila frowns and pulls out her comlink she calls into it- more like
yelling for a medical team, when she is finished she gives a look to Vek
and nods speaking lightly, "They can help him more than we can...even if
it is in his mind." Oddly this this was not the first time she had called
for a medical team in the week...more like the third. She bends down and
continues to check on Bazil's breathing, while they wait.

        Slowly, the eyes that dot Bazil's face open, first a mere flutter,
and then they open fully, the globes peering around him slowly. A hiss
erupts from his mouth, "Get away from me... I'll kill you both." A growl,
and he throws his arm up against Vek, in an attempt to push him away,
immediately throwing his body sliding against the floor, and up on his own
two feet, "You should have known better, and to have stuck me harder than
that, Emanuel." He grins evily, and raises his fists, "Again, you bloody
fool. I'll show you not to mess with my friends again." A glance is cast
to Lelila, and he proffers, "Get out of here. I'll deal with /you/ later.
Get yourself cleaned up... and what the fark is that costume about? Get
into a proper navy uniform... the Admiral would be most unpleased to hear
that his prized Star Destroyer Captain was trussed up in some silly flight
outfit." His glance once again turns to Vek-Emanuel, and he grins, "Come
at me."

Rolling backward over his shoulder and coming up in a crouch, Vek draws
his blaster from its holster and simultaneously unclips his comm from his
belt. "Security up here, on the double," he calls into the comm, clicking
it off, but leaving the blaster leveled at the man. He knew how dangerous
McKenzie could be and wasn't going to take any chances, not now, not while
the man was in his current state. The name Emanuel means nothing to the
pilot, but he can tell that the personality McKenzie is exhibiting seems
to be Imperial. Standing up, he motions for Lelila to get behind him, a
grim determination settling on his face, staring hard at the man. "Don't
make a move, or I will fire, whoever you are," he says coldy, flipping the
blaster concentration down to minimum. 'Where are those guards?'

Altair trots out of the muster room, having no idea about the show she is
missing in the hangar bay. Tra la la. Happy Colonel. But as she steps out
of the muster room, and notices Vek with his blaster drawn and aimed at
Bazil, seh looks puzzled and confused. "What is going on here?" she asks,
placing her hands on her hips and walking over to the assembled group. She
stops somewhere in between the Intel Director and the Ghost pilot, making
any shot at Bazil from Vek a tough one.  Turning to Vek, she says, "What
do you think you're doing?"

Lelila stands up and walks over toward Vek, but silently prays that he
won't do what she thinks he will do...she knew Vek's reaction toward
Imperials, it was even stronger than hers, he would fire. She frowns and
whispers toward him still keeping a frown, "Don't Vek...Bazil is armed,
and it's not just that sword." She remembers their last meeting on
Coruscant...Seeing Altie she calls out undaunted, "Bazil's mind has
gone...a minute ago he was a Jedi now he's an Imperial." In her mind she
reapeats the same as Vek, where are the guards?

        Calmly, the distorted man rolls his head back and laughs loudly,
before turning his gaze back onto Vek, "Oh please.  You really expect me
to believe you'll shoot your Commodore, not to mention brother? I don't
think so, Emmanuel. If you fire that pistol, you'll be as good as dead."
Obviously, he doesn't think anything of the fact that he called for
security, at least on the outside. Imperial or not, the personality is
definately dangerous. "Come on, fight me like a man, Eldar. I'll show you
a good time, and even go easy on you. I promise." The word 'Eldar' slips
out, somehow... as if a cry from Bazil's very soul. Until the proffered
question from Altair is ushered out. The very voice seems to strike at his
very heart, his mind and soul yet again tearing away. Something inside of
him is fighting... someone... the good old Bazil. Who just wants to be let
out. Again, his hands clutch at his head, and he whimpers softly, pain
coursing through his face, a solitary drip of perspiration falling from
his skin. Finally, though, he seems to relax... every trace of emotion
fades from the man's face, and he opens the eyes, turning his head around,
as if searching for something he can't see... he nervously offers, "Hello?
Is anyone there?" Strange, that he asks that... they are right in front of
him...

Lifting the pistol with the point up, Vek looks at Altair and beckons with
his free hand for her to move toward them.  Turning his gaze back to the
shaken McKenzie, Eldar drops the blaster to his side, unsure of what do
say or do next. Half a second ago he was ready to shoot the man, but now
he wasn't certain at all what to do. Clenching his jaw involuntarily, he
reaches for Lelila's hand and squeezes it, not only for comfort, but also
to prompt her to make some sort of move to remedy this situation.

"Bazil?" Altair asks, turning around to face the man as he speaks. He
didn't seem quite right, and she had a feeling that there must have been
_some_ reason why Vek had his blaster drawn. As a security squad tromps
off the turbolift, the Colonel moves closer to the confused Intel
Director. "Bazil? What's going on?" she asks, her brow rather furrowed.
She approaches him cautiously, never taking her eyes off him, just in case
he should suddenly become violent.

Lelila nods squeezing Vek's hand back, it looks like she wasn't going to
have to do much at all, because right behind the security was that blasted
medical team...the Hangar Bay was becoming crowded indeed. Though at this
state Bazil was fading fast, what could have possibly happened to him. Her
mind repeats over and over, remembering she had been a similar state only
a few months before.

        The sound of Altair's voice is definately mistaken, and he turns
towards her, his eyes never quite focusing straight on her... "Casey?" He
blinks, slowly, trying to see, "Is that you hon?" Casey. The name, to
anyone who had managed to get Bazil to talk up his life stories to them in
a bar, would definately mark the most known thing about him... Casey, the
woman he loved so long ago, who disappeared into the mists. "I... I can't
see... that Horansi sliced my eyes up pretty bad... I don't know how long
I've been in this cell now... maybe a few days..." The proffered words are
simple, and sincere. He slowly raises his arms, searching for Altair's
body in his darkness of the mind, "Where are you?" The previous two
personalities had definately not been him... but this... this
personality... it is like him, most definately. Maybe a real encounter
with the Casey he knew so long ago?

        Tromping into the room, the security detail arrives--three armed
guards, their carbines at their sides. Glancing at the Flight Officer who
called for them, one asks in a low baritone, "What seems to be the
problem, Officer Eldar?" They uneasily finger their weapons, eyes fixed on
the behavior of McKenzie. The medical team comes up behind them, two
officers, their medkits at the ready.
        "Security, I'm sorry to have bothered you," Vek admits, sighing.
"I'm not sure there is much you could do in this situation." Looking over
his shoulder to the medical team, Eldar's expression relaxes as the ready
their equipment. "Took you guys long enough. I'm not sure what you can do
for Chief McKenzie, though," he admits.

Altair holds up her hand to the security guards, tossing them a look
telling them they shouldn't leave just yet. Bazil wasn't exactly acting
"stable" or "normal" or even "sane" by any definition of any of those
words. So maybe they should hang around just in case. "No, Baz. It's
Altair. You're on the Deliverance, remember?" She represses the urge to
say, De-li-ver-ance, like she were talking to a three year old. Waving the
medical crews over, she stands nearby as they begin to examin the fleet's
Intel Director. "It's okay," she croons. "The doctors just wnat to make
sure you're okay. They'll fix you right up." That they would actually "fix
him right up" was really rather doubtful, but it might help to say it
anyway.

Lelila hangs back watching the medical team come closer to Bazil and
Altie, while the security teams leave alltogether. She doesn't say much,
or even think much by now, but somewhere in her optimistic soul she
belived that they would 'fix him up...'

        "Altair... Deliverance... doctors? What's going on, Casey? What is
all this about?" He seems to be lost in his own mind. Everything, his
entire life, boiled down to this. Multiple personalities, making him
believe he is in the cell on Nar Shaddaa where he spent a week, so very
long ago... when Casey was still around. Whether he knew what was going on
or not, is anyone's best guess, "Cas--Altair?" He starts off again,
"What's happening to me? I don't know who I am... my mind...  mess...
chaos... help..." The words start to jumble up, his body starting to sway
back and forth, even with the medical officers trying their best to keep
him upright. His breathing quickens again, he gasps harshly for breath.
His eyes seem to flicker back into life again, and he stares directly at
Altair, his prior commanding officer, his friend, with supreme
recognition, hopelessness, confusion, and sadness, "Help..." The word is
proffered up softly, almost whispered, before the pain slowly begins to
return to his face, the muscles clenching up as before...
