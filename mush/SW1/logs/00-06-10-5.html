Players Involved: Vauki, Marcus

Synopsis: 

Background: 

Marcus' Description:
        Before you stands a human of about 20 years with short black hair
and deep green eyes. His build is on the small side, being only 5' 2"
tall, and is thin, weighing about 110 pounds. He looks around with a
slight smile, looking just a bit shy. He wears a blue, loose-fitting shirt
and black denim jeans. On his feet are a pair of worn work boots, and he
wears a black leather vest over his shirt. On his hands are a pair of
fingerless gloves, a sturdy belt around his waist. Over it all is a brown
leather longcoat with a high collar, and on his head he wears a black cap
made of worn leather with plates of dull grey steel rivited to the front
and bill. He seems to be the carefree sort, almost always smiling or
laughing, and his posture is relaxed.

Vauki's Description:
        Prominantly displayed on this man's body is an entirely black
jumpsuit, of some flexible yet stiff material. The material covers his
entire body, save his hands and feet, and the head atop his shoulders. A
solitary stiff black piece of the familiar material is wrapped about his
neck tightly, leaving very little exposed on his body. His feet are clad
in simple black leather boots, while his hands and head remain exposed
completely. The only real thing standing out on him is a simple slap-on
style KIF logo patch on the left breast. The garb seems to have very few
seams, only a solitary visible one residing at the very front, extending
all the way down to the crotch from his neck.
        His skin is well tan, his hands worn and rough. The face is just
as rough, if not more, a solitary long scar running diagonally across his
face, ending in a pink spot near his chin. Various other smaller scars
reside over his young, yet worn, face. The eyes are clear and bright,
shining forth a bright green, striking against the well-ravaged skin. The
scar on his face slices through a piece of his left eyebrow, leaving a
piece of it gone, the hairs having not grown back still. The hair atop his
head reflects youth of an age gone past, tinted green at the tips, and
growing progressively darker to black at the roots. He keeps the hair
straight up, poking into the sky like some sort of surreal cityscape.

==LOG BEGINS==

Coronet Space Port - Coronet City

        This port is busy, like most, but here the hot breath of takeoff
and the deep rumble of engines is closer, more of a feature of the port
than an annoyance. The landing pads and small maintenance bunkers sprawl
across a large open area open to the sky and surrounded by blast walls to
protect the farmlands beyond. Pilots, engineers and techs, mostly natives,
move among the hardware as if at home in the confusing and fast paced
Port. A large complex off to the side houses control functions, transport
authority offices, and the CorSec station.

SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- KIF LoanShark careens into the area, her
entirely black-clad pilot guiding her carefully around the pockmarked
splotches of people which seem to inhabit the area this late in the night.
The headlamps on the vehicle flow forth from her, eventually finding their
mark on the Triton.

Marcus looks up as the lights hit the Triton, working on something on top
of the ship with his cap turned ackwards. He sets down a couple tools and
watches the swoop pull up, reaching back to turn his cap around.

This late at night, it's hard to tell who the swoop belongs to, or who
rides it. The most distinguished thing on the vehicle, though, is the
artwork of a shark covering it. Slowly, the pilot keys the vehicle off as
it comes to a stop a few feet from the freighter. The swoop falls to the
ground softly, her landing struts digging into the soft ground. The pilot
climbs off, his head completely covered with a black helmet, hands covered
in black gloves, both of which match the black jumpsuit covering his body.
Reaching up, he unclasps the locks on the helmet, and pries it off,
revealing the scarred face of Mege Vauki.

Marcus nods to himself, standing up, "Hey Mege. Where ya been?"

"Down at the races... just finished talking to one of my fellow grade
racers. Damn, I'm tired. Any news on the Imps?" Mege runs a gloved hand
through the green spikes that are his hair slowly. As the fingers pass
over them, the hair springs back into it's vertical position humorously.
If it weren't for Mege's solemn look, it might ilicit a laugh from anyone
seeing it.  The face is tired, and even in the dim light, it's easy enough
to tell. His eyes droop visibly, sagging beneath them. The lights of the
starport shine softly down, creating an eerie yellow omniescant glow over
the entire area, leaving only those areas under the ships dark with
shadows.

Marcus shakes his head, climbing down off the top of the Triton, "No...
Nothing so far. een kinda boring lately, so I thought I'd do a little
maintenance on a couple things." His feet touch the ground and he leans
back against the side of the ship, "How are you placin' so far?"

Mege carefully sets the black helmet atop one of the steering handles,
before prying off the leather gloves which adorn his hands. Slowly, he
unbuckles the neckpiece of his jumpsuit, before responding, "Well... I'm
third place, right now. Got bumped back by Kartijan Lore. Still a good
placing, though."

Marcus cools and cocks his head, hooking his thumbs in his belt after
wiping them on a rag, "Think you'll win?"

"Well, I can't get any higher 'n third now, but I don't think there'll be
any more racers in my division. So, I'll probably have to deal with third,
unless one of the other competitors dies before then. Ernie Pallando got
in a really bad wreck during his run, and he's in first place right now."
Mege sighs, looking quite compassionate now at the revellation of bad
news.

Marcus damns and shakes his head, closing his eyes for a moment, "Hope he
gets better soon. I hear those swoop wrecks can be vicious." He opens his
eyes again, looking around, "So, gonna come in for a drink?"

"Yeah, sure. Might as well. Lemme just drag m' swoop inside the ship
really quick, and then we can head into the bar."  Without waiting for a
response, Mege boards his swoop, starting the engine with a roar, and revs
it up the ramp into the ship.

Marcus nods as you come back out of the ship, "On to the bar?"

"Yeah," Mege responds, clanking down the ramp of the ship, now lacking
both helmet and gloves. He sets forth to the bar.

Cantina - Smuggler's Dig

        The Smuggler's Dig is known throughout Corellia as a place where
only the extremely cautious dare to enter. The main Cantina section of the
Dig is a place where many brawls -and deaths- have occured. At this
moment, the cantina is filled with many creatures, some humanoid, and some
not. The air is filled with the haze and musky smoke expelled from
differant makes of cigarras. A long bar is situated over at the northeast
corner with many stools gathered 'round.

OOC Note: Type "+barhelp" for a list of bar-related macros.

 &lt;O>ut leads to Coronet Space Port - Coronet City.

Marcus looks around as he enters after you, whistling low to himself,
"Rough crowd..." He looks at Mege, "I'll let you pick a tale or somethin'.
Just to be safe."

Chuckling, Mege nods, "Yeah. I used to come here a lot, with an old friend
of mine." He wanders over to one of the corner booths; a small, secluded
one, with little light coming in.

Marcus slips into the booth close ehind Mege, leaning back and relaxing in
the perceived safety of the gloomy interior. He looks around the booth for
some kind of menu or list of drinks. It's pretty obvious that he hasn't
been in a bar many times before, if at all.

As the pair seat themselves, a fair looking waitress wanders over to the
table, and inquires, "What can I get ya gents?" Mege has his hands clasped
on top of the table, as he peers up to the woman, "Bring over a bottle of
Corellian Whiskey." She smiles, nods, and turns away, wandering over to
the bar.

Marcus looks up too late and hmm?s "He looks around again, taking his cap
off and setting it on the table, "So, you came here a long time ago?"

"Yeah. I used to frequent this place for a few weeks, before my friend
disappeared... haven't been back since." Mege sighs, peering around the
bar slowly. It had been a long time. All too long, but not long enough to
forget Casey...

Marcus ahhs quietly, looking around... "Was he ever found?"

Mege shakes his head, "She... and no. I never saw her again. One day she
was here, talking to me about joining the Republic, and the next day...
she just vanished."

Marcus hmmms... "What was her name?" He's got his fingers steepled under
his chin, eyes narrowed in deep thought.

"Casey," the pilot-turned-racer offers, reaching a solitary hand up to
stroke at his neck, where the gold chain usually resides. The gold chain
which is just as much a part of Mege's body as his arm. He had to take it
off this weekend, unfortunately, to race; and to keep him jumpsuit
wearable.

Marcus nods, "Casey what? And can you tell me of the kinds of things she
may have been involved in? Academies, schools, jobs... Anything?" He seems
to be watching his cap, his tone low and measured; behavior that he hasn't
shown before.

He shakes his head softly, "I don't remember her last name anymore... she
only told me a couple times." Sighing, Mege shrugs, "She was with StarMed
for a while... Casperian Marines... and she was headed into the Republic.
Not that it really matters...  I spent three months trying to track her
down after she disappeared. And she did just that... vanished, without a
trace, into nothingness."

Marcus hmmms and nods, muttering to himself, fingers still steepled under
his chin. The only word that can be clearly made out is 'start'. The rest
are lost in the backgrond noise of the ar patrons.

Perfect timing, the whiskey arrives from the woman, "Will there be
anything else?" Mege shakes his head, and utters, "Nope."  The woman
smiles, and nods, leaving again. "I just wish she hadn't disappeared so
abruptly..."

Marcus nods, "There may e a trace of her burried somewhere... When did she
disappear?"

"About... a year ago." Mege sighs, filling his glass with the brownish
liquid, "I even hired a local slicer to find what he could about her...
nothing. It's as if she simply /vanished/ from the universe, without a
solitary trace."

Marcus nods, "Well, you got somethin' better than a local slicer now." His
nearly monotone voice picks up to it's usual tone, and a cocky grin, one
of his seemingly favorite expressions, appears on his face, "You got me."

Vauki grins, and nods, taking a draw from the glass, keeping his eyes
intent on Marcus, "If you think you could dig anything up, it would be
much appreciated. I doubt you will, though."

Marcus heh's and flips his cap onto his head at a jaunty angle, winking,
"Hey. I'll see what I can pull up. After all, I have doors into places
that a local slicer couldn't even get near."

"Very good point. Hell, I'll even pay you if you come up with somethin'."
Mege raises his glass to the man, "To the Republic, eh?"

Marcus smiles and raises an imaginary glass, having not gotten a real one
yet, "The Republic."

Vauki taps at the imaginary glass with his own, chuckling softly, before
drawing down more of the liquid. His eyes show sleep deprivation, very
much so, "Augh... I should probably get to sleep soon. I need to wake
early tomorrow, and watch the final races, before the celebration on the
Rancor. You gonna be there?"

Marcus nods, "I'll try to be."

"Great. Maybe I'll find a computer terminal for you up there," Mege winks,
before adding, "Let's go back to the ship. I'd rather not fall unconscious
before getting inside."

Marcus chuckles and nods, standing.

Vauki stands, as well, downing the rest of his glass, corking the bottle,
and picking it up. He tosses a few credits on the table to cover the
whiskey, and heads out of the bar.

Marcus follows closely, whistling a tune to himself.
