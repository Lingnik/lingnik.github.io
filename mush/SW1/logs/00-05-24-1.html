<p>Log Date: May 24, 2000</p>
<p>People Involved: Vauki, Thayra, Khirsah</p>
<p>Synopsis:
 While waiting for Patricio Rey, a general of the Griffons, Vauki becomes
agitated at his non-appearance.  A woman, apparrantly a diplomat, comes up
to him, and eventually the two get to talking, after Vauki reveals his job
of Intel to her.  The Griffs, unfortunately, don't know anymore than the
Republic, but have, nonetheless, sent out people for intelligence efforts
of their own.  The two trade an information-exchange promise, and part
ways again, leaving Vauki and his team in dead water, again.</p>
<p>Background:
 After a short excursion of trying to locate Patricio Rey, of the
Griffons, the intel team heads out to Pride 1 to meet him.  Vauki,
undercover as usual, sets off to find that very man, and hopefully get
whatever information the Griffon's hold on the latest Death Star threat...</p>
<p>Vauki's Description:
      A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face,
worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of
scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his
upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn,
threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other
locations. Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very
loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests
loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump
created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a
pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which
rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of it
is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the edges
of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas holster, in
which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming softly under
any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black leather, almost
militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no shine, and reach
nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost
scoundral-like demeanor.

<p>Thayra's Description:
   Thayra Delmund is a slim, 1.60m human female. She has a small, fine
featured face framed by very thin jet black hair that ends just a tad
under her jawline. Her eyes are almond shaped, with fine eyebrows over
them and so dark that it is difficult to distinguish the pupil. A small
nose and thin lips complete the picture.</p>
<p>She is wearing a single piece jumpsuit similar to those used by
comercial pilots. The jumpsuit is made of a light (caramel) brown fabric,
with a thin layer of padding underneat. It is fashionably enough to be
used outside a ship and discrete enough to be overlooked anywere near a
starport. It has an ample number of pockets and some straps to hold varied
equipment. The jumpsuit ends three fourths up her neck in a high collar
with a side button closure. Around Thayra's waist an equally generic belt
adjusts her clothes, giving away a hint of the wearer's shape underneat.
She wears a common pair of boots which are partially hidden by the
tappered legs of her jumpsuit. A headset comlink and a wrist chronometer
apear to be the only pieces of technology she wears.

<p>Main Hangar - Level 3 &lt;Pride-1>
 This is a place of gigantic proportions. You can see a dozen transports
scattered around the area, some of them being serviced by techs and the
rest being loaded and unloaded with all kind of goods. To the right you
can appreciate a huge collection of crates, barrels and every kind of
known container arranged over cargo pallets and ready to move. Near the
inner section of the Hangar many labor droids arrive in a continuous
stream to move the arriving goods into the station. You can see a lot of
people here, some of them are easily identifiable as businessman, pilots,
or military personel, but most of them are just anonymous figures moving
at a frantic pace to Type 'Registry' to see the registry finish today's
business. The screams of high powered engines and the sounds of the
machinery make it almost impossible to hear anything in this place.

 &lt;F>ore leads to Promenade - Level 3 &lt;Pride-1>.</p>
<p>As the _Triton_ sets down in the hanger, her vents open, sending steam and
other gasses out slightly from her. Slowly, the hatch under her massive
body clunks, and opens, slowly drooping to the floor. Finally, with a
thump, it sets to the floor finally, and a civilian clad man steps out, a
datapad slowly tapping against his leg.</p>
<p>Thayra, still standing in front of the news terminal, looks up as she
perceives some movement. She takes a moment to examine the newcomer and
returns to her reading....</p>
<p>As Vauki reaches the edge of the ramp, he hops off softly, his boots
thumping against the ground. Peering around, he frowns slightly, and
mumbles quietly, "Damnit... he was /supposed/ to meet me here." He reaches
into a pocket, pulling out a long green vegetable, and proceeds to munch
on it slowly, the piece of food crunching loudly in the hangar.</p>
<p>Thayra looks up again, frowning slightly as her eyes try to locate the
source of an out of place sound. As her eyes move over Vauki her expresion
softens. She smiles to the man, shaking her head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Vauki's attentions turn towards the woman, and blinks at her softly... he
blinks again, and then forces himself to munch quieter. He smiles back,
before looking around the area, and finally he plops himself down on the
edge of the Triton's ramp.  He sits there, looking quite bored, and
furthers his peerings.</p>
<p>Thayra taps on the terminal for the last time. After a brief pause while
the machine logs off, she moves around it, noticing the man for a third
time. Modifying her course to walk by his ship, she slows down, taking
some time to examine the craft and its owner.</p>
<p>"Hello there," Vauki says with a smile, prominantly displayed on his face,
despite the oh-so-obvious boredom. His foot taps slowly, to some unheard
rhythm. With his rugged appearance, he fits in right along with the
rustbucket behind him.</p>
<p>Thayra slows down to a halt before the ship's ramp,"Hello there...", she
says, answering the greeting,"Do you need any help?", she says a bit wary,
having noticed the man's seasoned look and his gallivanting around the
bay.</p>
<p>"Actually," Vauki starts slowly, his eyes perking with interest, "I'm
supposed to be meeting a... erm... Mr. Patricio Rey, or something like
that... but, he's not here as far as I can tell."</p>
<p>Thayra tilts her face slightly, obviously surprised,"Patricio Rey is his
name allright." Making a quick gesture she continues,"I think he's tied up
right now with some other meeting... Perhaps you should try the local bar.
He sometimes shows up there at the end of the day..."</p>
<p>Vauki frowns again; not the best news for him, "Sith... I can't stay long,
unfortunately. I was only supposed to be here long enough to talk with
him." He pulls his knees up to his chest, and wraps his arms around them
tightly, a disappointed look on his face.</p>
<p>Thayra, making a helpless gesture, says,"All I can tell you is that he
promised to be around later tonight, but I don't know when... Maybe I can
help you set a meeting with him for a later date...? Is this about one of
the hauling contracts?</p>
<p>A sigh is put forth from Vauki. Definately not the best news. A late
contact, and now, finding out that he'll have to get the cruical
information later. "Perhaps... though I am not sure when I will be able to
get back here." He looks the woman over slowly... judging her, almost
evaluating her. Slowly, he stands again, "No, it isn't." A quick dart
around the hangar relieves him of /some/ of his paranoia, "It is about the
Empire's latest little sadistic toy." His explation, he hopes, will catch
her attention... if she knows anything about current events.</p>
<p>Thayra's mouth draws an 'O' which lasts several seconds until she recovers
the ability to speak,"You're on of his informants then?"</p>
<p>Vauki simply stares at the woman, as he slips both hands into his pockets,
"Not exactly... I'm just an interested man.  /Very/ interested... if you
might get my meaning." His expression is solemn, and quiet. His posture,
erect, and militaristic in style. Sure, his outward appearance might
denote scum, but his posture and speech mannerisms are too distinct to be
such...</p>
<p>Thayras expression denotes some confusion by the conflicting signals she's
receiving from this man,"Uhh... I fear I don't get your meaning, Sir." Her
frown deepens,"But if Gen. Rey told you he'd see you then it must be
important enough."</p>
<p>"Seven years of active military duty, to be frank. I'm not allowed to
speak of from whence I came, but my affiliation is interested in this
information." Vauki sighs, his explanation reluctant, but necessary. "Do
you believe you could help me? I must depart by this evening, at the very
earliest." His speech is near perfect, although purposefully mangled.</p>
<p>Thayra, growing suddenly wary, says,"I do think you need to speak with the
general then. I do not know you so I am not sure if I can help you quench
your... curiosity. one thing I can do, and that is to notify the general
of your presence here and of your interest in seeing him..." She examines
the man yet another time,"...You said that he knows you, right?"</p>
<p>Another grumble eminates from the man, "He knows /of/ me. We have not yet
met; he was, however, interested in hearing what I had to ask of him, from
the limited communication we have participated in." His eyes grow shallow,
the lids closing in slightly. He's fed up with this whole predicament, and
is tired of dealing with it.</p>
<p>Thayra shows a pocker face, with little, if any, expression showing
through now,"What is it exactly that you are here for?", she asks,
omitting a name never volunteered.</p>
<p>"Like I said, any information your people might have on the latest
Imperial excursion of showing-off." Vauki's words are purposely cryptic,
to keep anyone else nearby from understanding the conversation as much.
"Specifically, inception place, research place, etc. Anything, more
generally." His eyes lift slowly, a bit, "Vauki. Mege Vauki." He offers
only the name...  almost as if he caught on that she wanted to know it.</p>
<p>Thayra crosses her arms,"If Gen. Rey knows you then you should talk to him
personally. I don't think I can get into what you're talking about without
knowing where what I speak with you may end..." She catches herself and
says, "Hypotetically, of course."</p>
<p>Vauki simply nods, as he studies the woman slowly. A poker face, all too
evident... he's been playing high-stakes Sabacc for /way/ to long not to
notice. But, to what end she puts it on, still remains a mystery to him,
"Pity. I wish your group good luck, then, should the Empire decide you are
a nuisance, and sends their new Death Star after /your/ planet." The words
are harsh, without a single bit of emotion playing through, "I'm afraid I
must be on my way." He turns, his face remaining quite expressionless, and
slowly heads back up the loading ramp to the Triton...</p>
<p>Thayra shrugs and says,"Oh, a nuisance we are. You've got that right.
That's why I have to be carefull. If you want to talk to Patricio, I'm
sure he'll see you. If you want to talk to someone else, you have to show
your colors as you did to him, because I won't be talking to just anybody
who stops by. I'm sure you can understand that."</p>
<p>She's right, and Vauki knows it. He hates being wrong, but in this case,
he has no choice... he stops dead in his tracks, only having made it
halfway up the ramp. Quickly, his mind runs through the consequences...
all the what ifs that have to be considered in this situation... what if
they're with the Empire on this... what if they don't have any
information... what if. It's his biggest dillema, but in the end, he
decides it best. If he can get the information... even if he dies in the
process... the Empire's latest creation would be vanquished. He turns,
simply, on a heel, and heads back down the ramp;  closing in on the woman,
he stops only a foot from her... close enough to feel the warmth of his
breath. He pries up the lapel of his tunic, and pries forth a long, round,
metallic chip, and dangles it in his fingers softly, "Before I reveal /my/
identity, I need proof of who you are." His words, now, are very hushed,
and clipped short.</p>
<p>Thayra keeps her eyes locked on the man's. She slowly inserts her hand on
one of her jumpsuit pockets, extracting a thin polymeric card, which she
hands over to him,"Does this help?"</p>
<p>STARFIGHTER: SubPro Wanderer Mk II -- CCS Keramisk arrives with a woosh
and slowly settles down on the landing area.
Khirsah steps off of the CCS Keramisk.
Khirsah has arrived.</p>
<p>Vauki presses his own chip into his mouth, and pulls the datapad from his
trousers. He slides the card into a slot on the bottom of the device, and
pulls it out again... not very standard issue of a device, to be able to
do that. His hands wisk over the pad quickly, and he looks up at the
woman, back down, and then back up. Pulling the card out without looking,
he hands it back. "Thank you, Mrs. Delmund." he offers, as his own chip is
pulled from his mouth, and he hands it over without a second thought, "My
name is Mege Vauki, New Republic Intelligence. ID number 189644. That chip
will confirm."</p>
<p>Thayra glances at the screen, needing only a quick glance at the complex
graphics to change her mind,"Follow me...", is the only thing she says.</p>
<p>Khirsah looks around after visiting the computer and getting his ship's
cargo into the process of unloading. His forelock shades his eyes, and his
gaze settles on Vauki, his eyes widening slightly. Khirsah half-waves, the
motion just enough to attract attention. He brushes at his forelock, and
looks Vauki over again, then nods.</p>
<p>Vauki nods solemnly at Thayra. His eyes catch the glimmer of motion off to
the side... the man from the holoterm... here.  This can't be good, unless
it's just pure cooincidence. But, then again, nothing in this universe
usually is... Vauki nods softly to Khirsah, in greeting, before turning
back to the woman, awaiting her lead...</p>
<p>Khirsah frowns slightly, then shrugs. Not like it's _that_ important to
talk to this guy. He turns back to his ship, checking to make sure the
unloading of the cargo is going smoothly.</p>
<p>Thayra, who has already turned towards the station's interior, fails to
notice the interaction between Vauki and Khirsah,"Let's go to the Rose. We
will look less conspicuous there..." She strolls quickly across the deck.</p>
<p>Vauki nods simply in response, and begins following her, matching her
speed with ease. One last glance is offered to Khirsah, and a grin. Quite
an odd encounter to say the least. Oh well... maybe the guy'll be here
when he's done with the Griff. Maybe.</p>
<p>Galaxy Rose - Level 3 &lt;Pride-1>
 Stepping into the Galaxy Rose, the bright light outside is suddenly gone
and you find yourself in a somewhat unusual environment. From the outside,
the tavern looks like any of a dozen or so other taverns one might see on
any of a number of worlds, but on the inside, someone has gone to great
lengths to make it unusual and attractive to a quieter and more mysterious
crowd. The lighting, what there is of it, is supplied by what appear to be
torches, glowing and flickering of the well detailed, cavern like walls.
What the torches illuminate is very much a realistic cavern with some very
fantastic details added. 'Booths' are offered in a vast variety, all
appearing very private and quiet, the rock faces reflecting sound into the
booths, not out of them, allowing for some security for the tastes of some
of the customers. The almost hidden band plays softer music most times and
allows for some conversation that most harsh bands drown out. A 'balcony'
looms above the bar as a sort of deluxe dining area for the special
guests, a waterfall trickling down the side of it into a rather large
'pool' that with its Transpara-steel cover serves as a dance floor, lit
from below from unseen sources with vibrantly colored fish dancing below
in their own environment. Servitors are hardly seen as they blend into the
surroundings, attempting to be as unintrusive as possible.

<p>Thayra walks over to a secluded booth, sliding into its shadows,"What are
you here for, Mr. Vauki?"</p>
<p>Sliding into the booth as well, Mege positions himself in the seat
opposite the woman, "Exactly one week ago, the Empire launched a surprise
attack on the planet Gastus, as you may be aware. They destroyed the
planet, with what we very much assume to be a Death Star, given it's
configuration. The Emperor has learned from past mistakes, and kept what
information there is very tight. He even got rid of several of our
undercover agents, in the process... he hasn't even told those closest to
him." The man leans forward slightly, hushing his voice even more. "I'm
here to find out what your people know."  His face is very taut, carrying
a very hard expression upon it.</p>
<p>Thayra nods at each fact mentioned by Vauki. As he asks his question she
smiles humorlessly,"For a moment I thought you were going to offer us a
hand... sould we become a nuisance to the Empire yet again...". Switching
to a more businesslike tone she says,"We know basically the same facts you
do. And given the massive firepower demonstrated we had to consider a
Death Star as a likely possibility, thought tere may be others. Apart from
the news brought by some traders we have no eyewithness accounts. As far
as we know nobody has seen a Death Star nor can anybody say for sure what
may have caused the planet to burst apart. It's all still gossip and
conjecture.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that it was burst apart by that monstrosity. I was /there/
when they did it. Hundreds upon thousands of lives, gone within a word."
His face grows quieter, and more soft... "It was horrible. And I assure,
you, Madam, if you offer us information, we /will/ destroy that blasted
fortress. We don't want our space destroyed any more than you do."</p>
<p>Thayra frowns,"Did you see the actual Death Star?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It approached the planet, whilest an armada of her TIE fighters
approached the ship I was on... and in half a second, the planet was
burning, right as we jumped into hyperspace." The expression is sad,
now... Vauki is obviously distraught by what he experienced.</p>
<p>Thayra sets her jaw into a thoughtfull expression,"This changes things. We
thought there were no witnesses. At least none would come forwards."</p>
<p>"I assure you, madam. There were witnesses. I am unable to tell you who,
but there were. I believe, however, IGNews has a bit of filmed footage,
however, if you contact one of their branches..." Vauki again sighs, and
leans back, "I assume, then, given your reactions, that you do not have
any more information than we ourselves have..." The words are more stated,
than questioned.</p>
<p>Thayra gesticulates as she says,"We alerted some assets as soon as news
got to us. They seem to be on the trail of something but we haven't heard
anything concrete from them yet." She bites her lip,"Frankly, we think we
lost them. They missed a contact already..."</p>
<p>Vauki solemnly nods, his eyes a bit brighter, "I know how it is. I've been
working this case for days now, without /any/ leads." He draws his arm up,
pulling back the sleeve, and peering at the small crono on the wrist...
"Blast. I must go quite soon, I'm afraid. Should you have any information
you wish to pass along to me, you may contact my associate in the New
Republic, Captain Jonau Diggs. He knows how to reach me when I'm out and
about..." He sighs again, closing his eyes; in the dimmed light, it
doesn't much affect his sight.</p>
<p>Thayra nods and says,"I will... but will you tell you anything you find
out yourselves? I know you have a strong fleet, but you're going to need
everything you can scrap if you ever find where this thing hides..."</p>
<p>Vauki sighs, his eyes opening slightly, just letting in enough light to
see her form, "Yes... we will. I will gladly have our government pass
along any information as it comes... this is a bad time for us all. If we
can't stop that machine...  we're all doomed." The words hark a sense of
fortune-telling... of the bad sort. With that, he stands, and extends a
hand, "Farewell, madam. Good luck with your own efforts."</p>
<p>Thayra shakes the offered hand,"fare well..."</p>
