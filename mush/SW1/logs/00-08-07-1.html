Bazil's Description:

        Prominantly displayed on this man's body is an entirely black
jumpsuit, of some flexible yet stiff material. The material covers his
entire body, save his hands and feet, and the head atop his shoulders. A
solitary stiff black piece of the familiar material is wrapped about his
neck tightly, leaving very little exposed on his body. His feet are clad
in simple black leather boots, while his hands and head remain exposed
completely. The only real thing standing out on him is a simple slap-on
style KIF logo patch on the left breast. The garb seems to have very few
seams, only a solitary visible one residing at the very front, extending
all the way down to the crotch from his neck.
        His skin is well tan, his hands worn and rough. The face is just
as rough, if not more, a solitary long scar running diagonally across his
face, ending in a pink spot near his chin. Various other smaller scars
reside over his young, yet worn, face. The eyes are clear and bright,
shining forth a bright green, striking against the well-ravaged skin. The
scar on his face slices through a piece of his left eyebrow, leaving a
piece of it gone, the hairs having not grown back still. The hair atop his
head reflects youth of an age gone past, tinted green at the tips, and
growing progressively darker to black at the roots. He keeps the hair
straight up, poking into the sky like some sort of surreal cityscape.

Kimber's Description:

Kimber is a young, human woman who looks to be in her mid 20's. She has
shoulder length dark brown/red hair that tends to look more brown or red
depending on the light. It is somewhat wavy and cut with bangs, though she
will style it it different ways depending on her mood. Her eyes are brown
in color, sometimes seeming to twinkle with some joke she hasn't shared
with the world. Her clothing is simple and practical, but nice.

Xanatos' Description:

        The being before you stands aproxmately 1.79 meters and extremely
lanky, a tad taller then most of his race which is easily determinable by
any person with knowledge of the outside galaxy as a Twi'lek. The two
lekku drooping from the back of his head, wrapping around his shoulders
give it away. His eyes, which are ever so slightly slanted at the end, are
the color of a well polished piece of Jet. As is normal for his race,
there is no hair on the top of his head, only the Lekku. His mouth is
usually slanted into a smile, grin, or smirk for one reason or another,
occasionally showing his pointed teeth.

        Over his stringy form, the Twi'lek wears an odd looking set of
clothing. His top could be accurately described as a silken tunic.
Triangle of red starts at either shoulder, comming to a point in the
middle of his chest, and the middles of his back of the opposite side. The
rest of it is black, except for a set of polished brass buttons down his
front. On his legs, he wears a pair of wide legged pants, silk as well.
There are a pair of pockets at mid thigh, then again at mid calf.  On his
feet, he wears a set of black boots, that are always kept clean.

White Knight VIP Nightclub
--- First Floor: Lounge --------------------------------------------------------
 The lounge is the entrance point to this elegant yet futuristic looking
nightclub. The atmosphere here can be described in one word: rich. Soft
light comes from invisible light fixtures, located in no place where they
can be seen. The floor is covered with soft carpet of an dark color that
can not be identified because of the lighting. The walls of the club are
lined with flourescent light fixtures shaped into various shapes and
lines.
        Various soft furnature can be found throughout the lounge for
those either waiting for a table in the lounge or those who want to escape
the loud atmosphere of the bar. Server girls are present to take drink
orders, and several hostesses direct guests to the anti-grav tubes leading
to the dining rooms and the casino.

Bazil walks into the lounge from the outside.

"That sounds like a good enough idea to me." Xanatos replies, offering his
hand a second time. "Glad to have you on board."  Just then the waitress
returns with his order, setting it down infront of him.

Kimber grins and nods, her smile broad. She shakes Xanatos' hand firmly.
The pair sit in abooth back from the bar, both of them with drinks. "It
sounds intriguing, I must say. Most of the ships I've lived on weren't
exactly big on the luxuries.  What's the ship like?"

Again, the doors to the club open, and in walks a man, trussed up in a
pristine swoop jumpsuit. His green hair pokes up, holding stiff as he
walks into the club, and slowly towards the bar, his eyes slowly glancing
about. Finally, he catches sight of his target: a booth near the bar,
inhabited by the male Twi'lek and human female. He makes his way forward
towards the booth, his hands slipped casually into the pockets in his
suit. As he arrives, he chimes in, "Heya, flashy. Thought I'd drop in to
say hey, and meet the one I sent to ya'." His head bobs towards the woman,
though the eyes remain fixed on Xanatos.

Xanatos raise an eyebrow as Bazil arrives. "Ah, Vauki. It's been a long
time since Caspar." He replies with a smile, taking a sip of his spiced
wine. "How have things been going since you gave up the Triton?" He then
turns to Kimber. "The ship, to put it bluntly, is a monster. It's got a .5
Hyperdrive, great sensors, and weapons to equal an ISD.... the ship itself
is rather nice. Lounge, Hotel... Casino... everything."

Kimber's eyes brighten and her smile grows broader. "It sounds heavenly.
Much better than the old YT-1300 I've been living on for the past 20 some
years." She glances up at Bazil and gives him a polite nod. "H'lo." She
turns back to Xanatos. "What sort of perks go with this job?"

Without waiting for an offer, Bazil pulls up a nearby chair and sits at
the end of the booth. Shrugging, he offers, "Pretty good. Out of the cloak
and dagger business for the most part now... full administrative duty, if
you get my drift. I can't complain, though. Finally ordered up another
ship to be refitted. Got me an X-point-five, now. Fully upgraded sensors,
the works... it's all good." He turns towards Kimber, smiling softly, and
nodding in return, "Hey." Slowly, he pulls a datapad from some concealed
location on his suit, and fiddles with it atop the booth top, keeping one
ear cocked to the conversation.

Xanatos smiles faintly, "Should have contacted me, Vauki. I'm fairly good
friends with someone in the ship upgrade business..... I've got myself a
nice little Gnat with a few pumped up things.... and a .6 hyperdrive. Came
with the job, just like the 100k signing bonus." He grins, turning back to
Kimber, nodding. "Much better then a YT... Free room, free access to all
the facilities, of course.. and you get to meet quite a few interesting
people."

Kimber quirks an eyebrow as she hears what Xanatos got for this business.
"Sounds great. Travel the galaxy in comfort? What else does one need?" She
says with a grin. She seems excited about the opportunity. "Anything else
I might need or need to know?"

"Lucky bastard... a hundred grand is pretty damned good. Anyways, here's
the official release grants and mission authorization. Full cover
privaledges. I assume you've already got all your team member covers set
up?" Bazil slides the datapad in his hands forth over the table, towards
the Twi'lek.

Xanatos nods his head. "Of course I do. You know me better then that." Xan
chuckles, accepting the Data-pad, "Though at the moment, I don't have much
of a team. Miss Pallas here, and I'm going to try to snag Pink once she's
finished with her current stuff. Other then that, I'm going to keep the
rest of the ship out of it, for security reasons." Then to Kimber, "Yes,
there's the animal managerie.... I hope you're not alergic to Rancors,
Wampas, or Banthas?"

Kimber shakes her head. "No, no allergies that I know of." She glances at
Bazil, perhaps a littler nervous now that mission details are being
discussed. After all, thought, this is the first real mission she's been
assigned to. She is still a little unsure about some things.

"I ought to get back to the mothership, guys... you two have any questions
for me 'fore I head off? I'll mostly be on business tours for the next
couple weeks, probably." Bazil peers between the two curiously, his eyes
momentarily lingering on Kimber, who obviously seems a bit shaken up, or
nervous.

"Nope, I think I've got this taken care of, Vauki." Xan replies, nodding.
"If I get into any problems, I'll give a hoot. All the secure encryptions
still the same?" He then looks to Kimber, "Alright, that's good... I'd
better get going for now, I'll catch up with you alittle later."
