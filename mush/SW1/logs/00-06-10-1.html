Players Involved: Vauki, Sargent, Luther_Syss, Altair, Piper(Announcer),
                  Whitney, Ernie

Synopsis: Vauki arrives just after the start of Altair's race, and watches
it with Luther Syss, the man he met yesterday.  He cheers Altair on, and
boos Ernie, the man who eventually beats his score.

Background: Vauki decides his time would be best spent to watch a few
races today, and so he heads up to the stands, to watch.

==LOG BEGINS==

From the Councourse comes Vauki, trussed loosely in his swoop garb. His
neckpiece hangs down across his chest, and the center crease is partially
opened, revealing a white undershirt, marked with a bit of sweat. His face
shows that same moisture, too, as well as a bit of elatedness. He's still
got that from his race yesterday. Slowly, he makes his way into the
stands, and turns, peering over the track and screens before deciding on a
destination...

From the Raceway -- "Ooooooooh," the announcer remarks mockingly as the
Achernar takes a turn for the worst through the third tube. "Nature girl's
gonna lose some time on the leaders with that little stunt! Let's see what
the standings are now!" As the swoops hurtle towards the skyline of
Tibannopolis and the vaulting ramp which looms in preparation to hurtle
them across the expansive valley, the scoreboard lists the Achernar at 29
SRU's, the Quicksilver at 79 SRU's and the Hilo at 63 SRU's.

From the Raceway -- The forest give way to a facade of Bespin. The male
Pallando straining to catch his mate keeps his mount in over thrust as
leans into it cutting his air resistance.

From the Raceway -- Hilo soars through the air at the end of the jump. The
pilot tries to skim the bottoms of the clouds as he tries to manuver for
the fastest paltofrm but lands in tube two to scream on continueing his
run.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver rolls into the
section as the swoop speeds across the repulsorpads before the strong
thrust into the nothingness of the air as the silver-coloured swoop and
rider streaks across the sky.

With the dark eyes locked on the track Luther Syss follows the race with
an intensity that shows an obvious interest. He even makes faces as
certain incidents takes place along the raceway, being so in it all that
he thinks he can help the racer with his mimics. The eyes trails of for a
moment, finding Vauki which he remembers since the day before. "Hey
there!" he calls out before returing to watch the race. "I'm afraid I
missed your race yesterday!" His voice travels above the crowds cheer as
he sits quite close to the wandering swoop racer. "How did it go?"

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver :lands hard on
the second platform as the rider narrowly misses the first, not looking
back, the rider continues speeding its way through the section and into
the next one.

From the Raceway -- "Nature Girl" did indeed regret her choice, and as she
emerges from the forest-y tube, she is covered in spinner webs and vines
and leaves. And mud. And other assorted forest items. As the Achernar jets
along, it spews shredded vines from it's exhaust pipe. Yuck. The wind as
the pilot jets at full speed towards the ramp launching her into Bespin
manages to blow a lot of the forest debris off her sleek swoop racing
outfit, but most of the mud stays caked upon her helmet and clothes.
Yuckie. It would weigh her down as she hit that ramp. A little.

Slowly, the rookiee swooper grins, and wanders over to Luther, taking up
the seat next to him, "Me? I did pretty damn well...  scored 199. Don't
think any rookiee's ever made it that high before on their first race." He
grins, "I've swindeled some guys out of the tape of it if you want to
watch."

From the Raceway -- The mud really didn't hurt the Achernar pilot that
much, as her great and exceptional skill compensates for that. Never mind
that in the last section, she nearly wiped out, or that her swoop was a
little ripped up by tree branches. Maybe the armor that fell off made up
for the weight up the mud. Yes. The Achernar hits the ramp just right and
soars high high over the Bespin track, landing on the highest ramp. Yay

Absentmindedly the Meditersarian grins, half-facing the swooper, without
withdrawing his attention from the raceway. "Sure, that would be fun." he
say and grins slightly as Achernar makes a fine manuver and screams a
cheer. "Not that she's my favorite or anything.." he excauses himself with
a chuckle. "Going to upgrade yourself anytime soon?"

"After three more races, I'll get 'er upgraded for free from me' team
cap'n. I might do a little work on her myself." He peers out over the
races, spotting Quila and Pallando... he watches them intently for a
moment. He doesn't know who the other racers are, so he decides to cheer
for Ernie. The one he knows. "I'll take ya' down to the pits later on, if
ya want. Show ya th' swoop, an' the holotape."

From the Raceway -- "Fly, nature girl, fly!" The announcer still seems
mocking, and the nickname has forever stuck. Altair, nature girl, Quila.
"I don't think she can catch up to the pace being set by the Pallando
twins, but Quila on the Achernar certainly has made a strong recovery from
that last section! Ernie Pallando is ahead of Quila with 95 SRU's to her
55, and Whitney Pallando is out in front with 121 SRU's! I wonder if they
do as well on water as they do in the air? We're nearing the Mon Calamari
section of the track, I bet we'll find out!"

Luther_Syss nods with some enthusiasm and actually looks at the swooper
next to him, not for long though. "That would be great." he grins happily
in his seat. "I love speed." the raspy voice continues. "It's the blood in
my life..." He stands up and screams a "Go Whitney!!" before getting
seated again. "Personally I fly starfighters, unfortunately you don't
experience the speed as intently as here."

From the Raceway -- Hilo recovers its stability getting the ground under
it after the jump and keeps itself in over thrust as enters the next
section of the track, the half way mark. The land give way to water and
remincesnt of the first section the pilot bumps, powering through the
waves. As the 3 way y is presented to the pilot he averts the swoop into
the narrow second tube.

Vauki grins, and nods, "It's the wind. I love it. I coulda' had my suit
sealed from the elements, but I actually paid more to have them leave a
crack beneath my helmet, so I can feel it. When you're going at a few
hundred clicks, you /feel/ the wind dig into your body. It's great." He
grins, and peers over, "Looks like Nature Girl might beat me. I only had
100 SRUs at this point..."

From the Raceway -- HIlo scims over the reef as if one with it. He swerves
s style through the pylons and even for benift of the crowd does a brody
off one of the larger waves that crest breaking on the reef. His engines
scream on propelling him ot the next section.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver makes a great
splash into the waters of the Mon Calamari as the swoop heads for the tube
just above the reef, the thick towers of coral, looming quickly in front
of the swoop as the driver appears to leave the swoop in overdrive most of
the time.

From the Raceway -- Fantastic manuevuring of the Quicksilver leads it to
avoid the coral reefs with such ease that it doesn't appear to have
anything there at all and all at the same breakneck speed that she started
out with!

Luther_Syss exhales a deep raspy "Yeah." to the conversation about winds
when racing. He frowns some, looking at a score table and nods. "She has
done good, 'specially considering how the rest of races has looked like."
He raises slightly in the seat, looking towards the left down the raceway
over the heads of the crowd. "Man.." He screams out something that sounds
like a warcry and gets some suspicious looks from the people nearby which
he answer with a savage Bah! That teaches them not to stare at a Ghankha
warrior.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Achernar plummets from
the heights of Bespin down to sea level. Into the ocean it goes with a
light splash of cool, artificial sea water. Salty! It turns the caked mud
on the pilots sleek racing uniform into a more gloppy runny gross mud,
that starts to run downwards. At full speed still, the pilot decides to
take the second tube.

From the Raceway -- Thankfully, the mud does not run onto the faceplate of
her helmet and obstruct her view. With no difficulty at all, the Achernar
zips through the towers of coral jutting out of the water. Meanwhile,
muddy mud drips inot Altair's boots.

Vauki chuckles, as he peers over the waterracers. Peering over one of the
screens, he focuses in on Quila, watching her racing with intent. After
almost a minute of that, he switches to Ernie. The better of the Grade 1s,
he takes more notice from the fellow pilot.

From the Raceway -- "Our wonderful sponsors have donated money and prizes
that everyone is competing for today," the announcer wings before someone
shoves a paper in his hand with the real copy for the advertisements on
it. "We at th Reckless Abandon Swoop Arena would like to thank CEC
Shipyards, Rendili Stardrives, Subpro Shipyards, the Black Krayt arena,
Indigo Entertainment, McTavish Enterprises," He pauses and sucks in a
breath, "Avalon Enterprises, Fineline Spaceways, and Nappa's Creations
Incorporated. If it weren't for these wonderful sponsors, we wouldn't be
here today, ladies and gentlemen, so please visit their advertising booths
downstairs and see what they can't do to help YOU out!" The scoreboard
lists the Quicksilver with 164 SRU's, the Achernar at 81 SRU's and the
Hilo at 131 SRU's as they head into the most dangerous section of the
first half of the track- the Lava Dragon habitat.

From the Raceway -- The Male Caspian keeps his confidence as things begin
to heat up in this section of the track. He keeps the engine equaly hot
keeping her in over thrust as steam ries from his wave wet swoop and is
dried by the dry heat. He steers the swoop into the second tube and makes
for the volcanic peaks.

From the Raceway -- looks like the Commodore got too cocky. A sudden falre
up send an unexpected turn in his direction to doge the flow. He looses
both speed and mometum. He seraches the track for a means of makking up
the lost time and in his unfocused flurry is deluged with sulperic gasess
form another of the vents vomits. chocking he and his swoop sputer
glancing off one of the peaks and battering into the next section.

From the Raceway -- To take or not to take, that appears to be the
question riding upon the Quicksilver's riders mind as the swoop swerves
from left to right hesitating between the middle and last tube, finally
she swerves into the middle tube and though some might call it cowardly,
others might call it practical as not many people would enjoy being lunch
for the dragon.

From the Raceway -- It appears that the rider might have made a mistake
heading into the middle tube as her superb manuevuring skills simply
hurtles her past the section easily. Being too far ahead to notice the
events occuring behind her, the rider heads blithely into the next
section.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Achernar is very clever.
Therefore, ti does not go into the dragon's lair. Instead, it heads into
the hot second tube. The heat once again begins to dry the runny mud she
had picked up way back in the forest. Altair scruches low over the
handlebars of her sleek, though slightly abused, swoop, and tries not to
get hit by any flying lava rocks.

From the Raceway -- The Quicksilver isn't the only one who makes the
middle lava tube look easy. The Achernar, too, rapidly zips through the
lava flows and steaming vents as if they were nothing more than
wildflowers and grass. If it weren't for the Hilo having issues with the
seemingly easy obstacles, one might think that this was a super lame tube.
Altair curses herself for not paying the dragon a visit.

From the Raceway -- "Ooh, and Pallando number one almost becomes a toasty
critter, folks!" Finally, the non-Pallando competitors are getting a break
from the announcer's evil mocking tone. "WHAT was he THINKING? He's
slipped back with 149 SRU's, still ahead of the Achernar who's trucking
right along with 103. Whitney Pallando still has the lead, though with 208
SRU's! The racers are gonna get a break now, as they round the corner
to... Beggar's Canyon!" The whooping and hooting of Sand People bubble up
through the speakers hidden in the arena stands.

From the Raceway -- Ernest shakes his head clearing his vision and uses
his shoulder to get the steam and debris off his helemt that he brings
with him from the Iron peaks. Lava grit streams off him in its own flow
bourne of the wind that pelts him. Trying to make up for lost time he
keeps Hilo's engines sceraming in over thrust as he enters the canyon and
its only tube, one.

Luther_Syss forgets where he is for a moment and halfrises in his seat,
looking around at the sound of the Sand People with an icy look in his
eyes...he sighs in anger at himself when he realizes his mistake, giving
the people looking at him in confusion an angry look before sitting down
again..three seconds later he seems to have forgotten his mistake as he
once again seems to be a part of the race judging from his enthusiasm.

From the Raceway -- Ernest finds the sweet spot throguh the canyon making
up for lost time and gaining on his mate in th lead.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver appears to
take it easy in this round as the swoop speeds through the area easily,
again the swoop appears to be permanently in overdrive with the driver's
skill of manuveuring into the only tube there.

From the Raceway -- As expected, the experienced rider of the Quicksilver
zooms through the section easily, as the rider even manages a peek
backwards to the second leader as though to ascertain herself.

From the Raceway -- Ahh, A break. An easy break. Altair hunches over her
handlebars for the relativly straight run through Beggar's Canyon. She
knew this place like the back of her hand. She had run through enough sims
of this canyon in her X-wing to know it's ins and outs. Of course, sand
people didn't usually pellet X-wings with things. She pushes the swoop
into overdrive.

From the Raceway -- But they do pellet swoops with rocks. And they pellet
the Achernar too. A particuarly well aimed rock indeed smacks Altair right
upside the head. And it sends her struggling to not tip over. And she
doesn't. but she hits the wall instead. Bump. Just a light bump.

Vauki frowns greatly to know enough when he's losing. And he's losing. He
knows Ernie's going to beat him, so he stands, and starts screaming Altair
on at the top of his lungs. Even the other yelling spectators around him
stop their cheerings to gawk at him oddly.

Luther_Syss grins broadly, sends the tattoos on his cheek all curled up as
he stands up next to Vauki and aids him in the shouting, and this
Meditersarian can shout allright.

From the Raceway -- The heated suns of Tatooine begin to fade away and are
replaced by a chilly breeze as the swoops rocket through the canyon and
towards the seventh section, the glaciers of Hoth. Out in front is the
Quicksilver, with 249 SRU's. The Hilo is behind it with 192, and the
Achernar is behind that one with 128 SRU's. The hooting of the Sand People
fades out and is replaced by the howling of very real, very dangerous
Wampas. One is animatronic, but the other's roar is nothing but
dangerously alive.

From the Raceway -- The roar of the crowds spurr Hilo's driver Earnest
Pallando ot kep the engines running hot between his legs as the glaciers
fields are entered. Ice chips form his wife spatering acrsos his helmet's
screen as he keeps the swoop in over thrust. The visionary distraction
make him perhaps inadvertently take the 2nd tube and its awaiting
animatronic.

A conservatively dressed young woman, known to some as Eva Sargent,
emerges into the stands. Having finished a fraction of the mounds of work
that she needed to do at the diplomatic offices here, she finally dares to
sneak out and take a break. She scans the rows and rows of seats, then
makes her way to a less densely occupied section about two-thirds of the
way up.

Vauki continues screaming at the top of his human voice, sounding much
like a certain Bazil some folks in the audience might know. The voice
roars out over those around him, who have now subsided slightly at the
psycho's rantings.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: CASE S-6c Akula -- #29 Hilo skims past the faux
Wampa with out incident but a sharp bank to the port sends the swoop
sprailling out of control. The por rider is battered against the icey
tunnel his torso removing a stalgtite from the cieling, Oooh is there a
fine for damaging the track's scenery?

From the Raceway -- Unaware of the accident occuring behind her, Whitney
continues to speed around the icy regions of the swoop as she swerves her
swoop into the second tunnel, the swoop skidding past the icy coldness
heading right for the faux Wampa

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver avoids the
Wampa easily as the rider swings into the next section, the swoop slowing
down as it makes the maneuvurs to avoid hitting the Wampas or any
stalagtites within the section.

Standing next to Vauki, Luther Syss aids the rookie swooper in the
shouting while he probably has no idea why or what he's hoping for by
this..but hey, it's a swoop race, of course you must scream and cheer and
whatever. He trails of for a moment, catching his breath while grinning
broadly, distorting the tattoos on his cheek, looking with amusement of
the man next to him and the energy presented..then he joins that energy
and continues his support shouting.

From the Raceway -- Into the blustery windy ice caves of Hoth. Brrrr. This
leather was so skimpy and not nearly warm enough. But the adrenaline keeps
her generally warm. The Achernar heads into the second tube, hoping to
avoid the wily wampa-matronic.

From the Raceway -- As the pilot emerges from the ice caves, she imagines
the crowd screaming her name triumphantly. It is so vivid that she nearly
really does here it. "Yay Altair!" they say. "Yay!" If she weren't busy
driving the Achernar, she would wave.

From the Raceway -- The nice, bright whites of the ice fade out to a dingy
gray as the swoops leave the frigid artic wonderland of meyhem and peril,
and dive into the sewers of Anoat where the Dianoga lurks down the
shortest of paths. His eye stalk pops up and a few tentacles flicker
around in anticpation. The scoreboard lists the Quicksilver at 288 SRU,
the Hilo at 216 SRU, and the Achernar at 151 SRU.

This being a swoop race indeed, Sargent's actions would probably fall into
the "whatever" category. She sits quietly on the edge of her seat in the
bleachers, quiclky snanning the scoreboards and the track. Her right leg
is crossed delitately ofer her left, and her hands rest on hte edge of the
seat. Whenever a swoop goes out of control, her grip on the seat tightens.

"SITHSPAWN!!!" Vauki shouts out, glaring intently at Ernie's swoop,
wishing his worst intentions on it, "Blasted man! Burn!" He again ilicits
more strange looks from those around him. This man has already lost the
first place, unless the man makes a fatal mistake on the last section. He
hopes he does, too.

From the Raceway -- gains its stabalization and upright postion with its
pilot nearly in tact. He gears down to full thrust as he makes for the
last section of the track in all its narrowness and awaiting tentacles.

Luther_Syss laughs out loud as Vauki starts cursing the 'thief' of first
place, shaking his head some. "Don't you worry." he says with the
aftermath chuckle. He makes room for an alien that walks between the seats
on the way out. "Won't you get another shot or have you raced all you
quotas?" He coughs some, clearing his throat even though he has such a
raspy voice to begin with that it won't make much of a difference even if
he had a banta down his throat..in breathen aspects perhaps.

"One race per tournament. Oh well... I'll still place. I hope." Vauki
utters, the last two words under his breath.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: CASE S-6c Akula -- #29 Hilo screams past the
Tentacled monster at high rate of speed. The diagona swipes but all it
passes through are Hilo fumes. DEbirs is blow past and the center of the
narrow tunnel stuck to as Ernie Pallando crosses the finish line and the
tumbles off his swoop in a bruised battered heap.

The cheering crowds in front of her are getting wilder an wilder as the
end of the race nears. Enthusiastically, ripples of fans rise to their
feet, if they weren't already. Her view of the track now completely
blocked, Sargent must also stand. She does just that, without much of a
fuss at all. The young wonam's serious gaze is still on the action. For
one moment, she ponders standing on top of her seat, as a few others are
doing. Given her lack of height, it wouldn't be a bad idea. But it is far
more proper and ladylike for her to stay put.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver head towards
the very real Dianoga, after all the rider appears to have defeated it
once, it would be her last chance to try for a score after she hears the
announcement, unaware of the accident that the other Pallando has
suffered.

Luther_Syss nods a little and shrugs. He begins to sit down but realizes
as well that that would steal him from the final run and changes his mind,
shouting some as well, this time it's those battlecries again...though now
the persons next to him doesn't react as they as well seems to have lost
their attention to the race.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Oblivion Skyrazor -- Quicksilver sweeps into
the Dianoga's path as the overconfident rider swerves past the tentacles,
towards the end as the rider was about to make for a clean sweep to the
finish line. A careless mistake leads the rider hurtling towards a
tentacle of the Dianoga, the creature picked up the Quicksilver like a toy
and simply throws both swoop and rider across the finish line to land
crashing in a heap after it. She did pass the finish line though, but at
what expense?

Hushes erupt as the female Pallando enters the home of the monster... As
Whitney crosses the finish line, more screams erupt from around, whooping
loudly as she makes it, no matter how. Vauki doesn't, however, his focus
fixed calmly on Quila, watching her intently with every speck of attention
he holds...

Luther_Syss shuts up as Whitney is hurled through the air, he frowns some
and tries to get a view to see if she's alive or have broken anything.

Sargent winces as both Pallandos appear to not be in very good shape at
all. She presses her lips together and starts to pick her way through the
seats toward the exit. She had come to the races hoping for a break, but
all the past few minutes have brought her is more worry.

From the Raceway -- The Achernar curves towards the second tube,
containing the viscous sewer monster. What a vile creature, with such long
arms and a big eye! Vile vile indeed!

Luther_Syss elbows his way to the front of the seats, looking down on
raceway to get a better view of the heap of Casparians down there. There
isn't without some opposition by the other people standing there but his
ignorance makes the let it go for this time.

From the Raceway -- SWOOP: Ubrikkian Phantom-Q -- Achernar bumps the wall,
alerting the wily dianoga to her presence. The creature's single eye pops
up above the water and stares at her as she struggles to not fall veer off
out of control. It's long arm just towards her, wishing to wrap itself
around her exhuast pipe. But she juts away just in time, crossing the
finish line just as the left armor of her swoop falls off onto the ground.
Thump. Then her engine coughs up some more vine and spits it on the ground
next to where the pallando's have collapsed.

From the Raceway -- As the racers cross the finish line- by one method or
another- the scores come up as finalized. Ernie Pallando on the Hilo for
Team Caspar clocks in with 276 SRU's, Whitney Pallando for Team Caspar on
the Quicksilver finishes with 332 SRU's, and Altair Quila on the Achernar
ends up with 178 SRU's. Medteams and pit crews from Team Caspar rush out
to collect the Pallandos as they collapse or are hurtled off their
machines. "Oh, _That's_ gotta _hurt_!" the announcer yells over the
deafening roar of the crowds whose bloodlust has finally been satiated at
Team Caspar's expense. Meanwhile, the large sign on the scoreboard that
says, DIANOGA has the number below it changed from 122 to 125.

A look to the display monitors overhead gives Sargent a close-up view of
the bits and pieces of swoop strewn all over the finish line. She shakes
her head when the Achernar adds to the mess with its own offering. Time to
go find somebody from the Caspian team crew. She disappears down into the
bowels of the arena.
