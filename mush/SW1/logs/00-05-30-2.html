<p>Log Date: May 30, 2000</p>
<p>Players Involved: Khirsah, Vauki, Xanatos</p>
<p>Synopsis: </p>
<p>Background: </p>
<p>Xanatos' Description:
        The being before you stands aproxmately 1.79 meters and extremely
lanky, a tad taller then most of his race which is easily determinable by
any person with knowledge of the outside galaxy as a Twi'lek. The two
lekku drooping from the back of his head, wrapping around his shoulders
give it away. His eyes, which are ever so slightly slanted at the end, are
the color of a well polished piece of Jet. As is normal for his race,
there is no hair on the top of his head, only the Lekku. His mouth is
usually slanted into a smile, grin, or smirk for one reason or another,
occasionally showing his pointed teeth.</p>
<p>Over his stringy form, the Twi'lek wears an odd looking set of
clothing. His top could be accurately described as a silken tunic.
Triangle of red starts at either shoulder, comming to a point in the
middle of his chest, and the middles of his back of the opposite side. The
rest of it is black, except for a set of polished brass buttons down his
front. On his legs, he wears a pair of wide legged pants, silk as well.
There are a pair of pockets at mid thigh, then again at mid calf.  On his
feet, he wears a set of black boots, that are always kept clean.

<p>Khirsah's Description:
He stands a good six and a half feet tall, not counting the untamed mass
of dark brown hair which sprouts from his head, and which hangs perhaps 3
inches long. Dark hazel eyes look out at the world from behind a forelock
of hair which always ends up in his face. His clothing is relatively
simple - a fairly loose short-sleeved shirt, a similar loose pair of
pants, and a sturdy leather belt - all of it in shades of brown, with the
shirt being lighter than the the pants.
The only thing which really saves him from anonymity is the pair of pale
triangles framing his left eye, almost like a scar.  A closer look,
though, shows that the odd appearance is actually natural.

<p>Vauki's Description:
        A mat of brown frazzled hair lies atop this man's head. His face,
worn softly, is still young, the lines still soft, but some amount of
scarring showing over a small amount of it. A black vest rests around his
upper body, enwrapping a plain white shirt; each being a little worn,
threads coming loose from the edges, and some small burns at other
locations.  Sleeves, also black, lie along his arms from the vest, very
loosely hung... perfect for hiding something. A simple silver chain rests
loosely around his neck, which leads down into the shirt, a small bump
created a few inches down from some unseen item. His pants consist of a
pair of loose black slacks, void of anything interesting, but upon which
rests a thick belt of some unknown material. The clasp at the centre of it
is simple, only a rounded rectangle, a bit of decoration around the edges
of it. At the man's right side is a large, thick, black canvas holster, in
which is seated a blaster carbine, the black metal gleaming softly under
any light. At the base of his legs, his feet lie in black leather, almost
militaristic boots. The flat black material gives off no shine, and reach
nearly a foot up his leg.
        His overall appearance notes nothing of interest, and an almost
scoundral-like demeanor.

<p>Docking Bay 87 -Mos Eisley-</p>
<p>A circular landing platform sits surrounded by a high orange
barrier wall. A hoverlift carries cargo from ships to the varrious loading
bays that cover eastern wall. Jawas scurry about, searching for droped or
open boxes. Sand and exaust fumes mix to form a distinct aroma. A pair of
worn blast doors lay on western wall, leading into the seedy depths of Mos
Eisley.</p>

 &lt;W>est leads to Customs Station -Mos Eisley-.</p>
<p>Khirsah is leaning on the starport's computer terminal, occasionally
touching the controls to select an option or enter something into it. His
attention is pretty much absorbed by whatever it is, as he doesn't notice
the arrival of the Triton or Vauki's exit from it, nor Mysti's arrival
from the Summoner. His forelock, for once, is pushed out of his face.</p>
<p>With deliberate measure, the Triton drifts through the hazy skies, her
engines burning brightly, even under the scathing sun. Finally, she sets
down in the docking bay, her landing struts digging into the loose sand
softly. She decompresses, jets of steam blowing out from her ports,
sending whirlwinds of sand and dust up around the area. After a moment,
her hatch opens with a clunk, and out steps Vauki, a bit tired, but in one
piece... his boots clomp down into the sand, leaving quite the imprint. He
shoos off a few noisy Jawas, each bearing a small pile of rubbish trinkets
in their arms.</p>
<p>Khirsah mutters to himself, his fingers drifting back and forth across the
terminal. Too much junk information, and not enough on what's produced and
what's needed here.</p>
<p>Khirsah pushes away from the terminal with a disgusted look, and finally
looks around the area, ignoring the Jawa trying to get his attention. When
he sees Vauki, an odd look crosses his face, seeming to combine surprise
and an odd certainty, as if he'd been expecting to see Vauki, but not any
time soon.</p>
<p>"Bugger off!" echoes through the docking bay, uttered quite loudly from
Mege's mouth. "I don't want to buy your sithspawn!"  He shoos the
incessant Jawas away quickly, mock-kicking at a few. He grumbles quite
loudly, the voice quite definately the man Khirsah met before...</p>
<p>Khirsah watches for a moment, and then chuckles slightly. He starts to
step away from the terminal, then turns back quickly and keys in a short
sequence before turning towards Mege again, and starting to stroll in his
direction, calmly ignoring the Jawas harassing him, as he ignored them
while tormenting the computer system. His voice rings out over the noise,
the deep bass carrying easily over the short distance. "Well - we meet
again, Mege!"</p>
<p>Swivelling quickly in his step, Vauki turns abruptly to the voice. That
man... again... either cooincidence, or pure fate has brought the two
together once again... and it seems it always just happens in the
strangest of places, "Khirsah... what are /you/ doing here? What is this,
third time in a week we meet each other out of randomness?" A lopsided
smirk plays over his face, covering the surprise from before. Sure, under
normal circumstances, Mege might be suspicious, but he can't let that get
the best of him here. It may seem strange, but Vauki knows it was only
through a random mistake with the holoterm the two met... probably just
fate showing her cards, again.</p>
<p>Khirsah grins. "Indeed - we meet in the strangest spots, no?" He finally
seems to notice the Jawas around him and Mege, and attempts to shoo them
off while continuing, "As far as what I'm doing here, I heard that the
people here are willing to pay decent money for a load of electronics -
finding out if it'll be profitable enough, with the shorter route, to make
it my main route." He gestures at the Pit Freighter. "Ended up with a new
ship, too, although I'm trying to talk my current employer into changing
the name." He gives up in his efforts to chase off the Jawas, and lifts an
eyebrow. "So what're you doing here?"</p>
<p>Vauki shrugs softly, "Seein' my mum, mostly. Hoping to see some old
friends from when I lived, here, perhaps, too...  depends." With not a
single second thought, Mege plops the palm of his hand down on one of the
nearby Jawa-heads, using the critter to lean on softly. If this were any
other place but Tatooine, the scene might look hillarious.</p>
<p>Khirsah chuckles slightly as Mege leans on the Jawa. "You were born here?"
He considers for a moment, "Wouldn't have placed you as being from
here..." He shrugs, and grins. "You're a professional swoop racer, you
said?"</p>
<p>A small blunder, but oh well... Vauki shrugs, and nods softly, "Yeah...
more or less... born as a slave, but soon got rid of that." The tone shows
that he's not very interested in saying much more... "Yeah... I try to be.
I don't call m'self the best racer, but I like to do it when I can."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods, not really worried about Mege's early history, "So - suppose
you could give me some advice, on swoops?" He looks around the landing
pad. "Not here, of course - maybe over a drink someplace?" He tilts his
head slightly in inquiry, his forelock abruptly deciding to hang in front
of his face again.</p>
<p>Vauki shrugs softly, "Sure... I've got to do some things first... need to
contact some friends on Caspar... tell 'em I won't be back for a bit."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods. "So - meet you someplace? Or just hang around here?</p>
<p>"Meet me in the cantina in a bit... be careful, though. It's a bit
dangerous." Mege grins, and winks softly. "It shouldn't take /too/ long to
get out my message."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods. "Sure - and don't worry about me, I have teeth of my own, if
I need 'em..."</p>
<p>Chalmun's Cantina -Mos Eisley-</p>
<p>The infamous cantina is just as it's been for nearly four decades.
Dark, smokey and filled with some of the most notorious and dangerous
characters Tatooine, or the galaxy for that matter, have ever seen. Dimly
lit, the cantina is filled with shadows, and many of the patrons use this
to their advantage. The blue droid detector hums as it scans those
entering.  The place smells of countless tabaccs and liquids, as well as
unwashed bodies. More noticeable than the stench, however is the sense of
danger and foreboding that hangs here.</p>

 &lt;O>ut leads to Main Street -Mos Eisley-.</p>
<p>Khirsah half-waves to attract Vauki's attention. He's sitting at an
otherwise unoccupied table, although most of the other tables and booths
are packed. The shadows and smoke filling the room make it hard to catch
his movement, despite the relative ease of picking him out of the room.</p>
<p>With his general, calm, and utterly relaxed stature, Mege fits right in
with the rest of the cantina's inhabitants. Despite the loud music playing
in the background, he does manage to collect a little attention from the
others in the bar. As he steps into the bar, a grin plays over his face...
he's home. He waves to Khirsah in response, turning towards the entrance,
as if waiting for someone or something...</p>
<p>Into the Cantina behind Vauki steps Xanatos, his hands carefully tucked
into the pockets of his pants. When he enters, his black eyes blinks
several times to adjust to the lightm and he follows behind Vauki a few
paces back, eying the room and it's patron's carefully while his lekku
slide and slither across his back.</p>
<p>Khirsah considers Xanatos for several moments, before leaning back in his
chair again, and waiting to see how it unfolds; he scowls briefly as his
forelock drops into his eyes, obscuring his vision, and spends a minute
trying to get the wayward hair out of his face.</p>
<p>Slowly, Mege makes his way through the bar, pushing around the various
other peoples crowded in the dark room. Finally, he reaches Khirsah's
table, and utters out, "Hey... I brought a crewmate. He was bored..."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods, and gestures to the chairs. "Sit down, then. More than
enough room." He grins, and nods to Xanatos in greeting. "Nice to meet you
- the name's Khirsah."</p>
<p>Xanatos nods, "Yes... Xanatos Baldur at your service." He adds, to Vauki's
brief introduction. He slips down into one of the chairs, after looking
down at it with a touch of disdain... after all, his entire suit is made
up of silk.</p>
<p>With a bit of a smirk, Vauki sets himself down in a free chair, offering
up to Xanatos, "I told ya we'd be in the rough part of town." He pulls off
his vest, and tosses it to the Twi'lek, "Here, use this."</p>
<p>Khirsah stretches, and twists his neck quickly, producing three distinct
cracks as he does so, before looking over at Mege.  "So - anything you
want t' talk about, or is it safe to toss a few questions about Swoops at
you?"</p>
<p>"Shoot, I've got some time to kill." Vauki replies slowly, shrugging
softly.</p>
<p>Khirsah nods. "Basics first, eh? What sort of Swoop would you recommend,
to start out with?"</p>
<p>"I'd suggest the Skyreaver, if you're looking for something low to
middle-class... otherwise, go for the more expensive Oblivion Skyrazer."
Vauki waves down a nearby waitress, "Hey, hon, gimme a bottle of yer best
Corellian Whiskey, kay?"</p>
<p>Khirsah lifts an eyebrow. "Corellian Whiskey? You've got good taste." He
grins, and considers. "Oblivion Skyrazer? All right... I'll remember that.
What other gear would y' suggest?"</p>
<p>Vauki shrugs softly, as the waitress wanders off, "Just the hardest stuff
you can find... if you go down, you'll go down hard. Get good quality
stuff... Avalon has the best. Also, if you can afford, upgrade your beast
right away."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods. "How much'd an upgrade cost, about?"</p>
<p>Vauki shrugs, "I forget, now. They ain't cheap, though... I can tell you
that. Probably cost you thrice your stock price to max out a swoop."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods again, "So close to 15-20 grand, depending, eh?" He swats
irritably at his forelock. "On a quick side note, you have a knife with
you that I can use on this damned thing?"</p>
<p>Almost instantly, a vibroknife flicks out of his shirtsleeve, the blade
flickering out of the handle, and buzzing slightly with the high pitched
whirring. He flicks it off again, flips it in his palm, and slides it
forth on the table, "Here ya go." Finally, the waitress returns with a
dusty bottle of the whiskey, and a few glasses, setting them all down on
the table. She smiles daintily, and inquires, "Will there be anything
else, gents?"</p>
<p>Khirsah picks up the vibroknife, flicks it on, and uses it to slash his
forelock off, before flicking it off again and sliding it back, and
dropping his hair on the table next to him. He eyes the glasses for a
moment before shrugging, opening the bottle, and pouring a glass for Mege
and a glass for himself. "Nothing that I can think of, lass." He grins
lopsidedly, and studies the whiskey through the glass for a moment. "Check
that - what year is this?"</p>
<p>Vauki takes in a small whiff, without looking at the bottle, "1BBE...
pretty decent stuff. Not the /best/ year, but it's still pre-endor." He
shrugs softly at the waitress, "No, thanks. This'll do." He withdraws a
wad of credits from a pocket, and drops them in her already waiting palms.
She grins ditzily, and wanders back over to the bar.</p>
<p>Khirsah lifts an eyebrow. "Indeed - pretty rare, these days. I'd
especially think it'd be hard to come by in a place like this Cantina." He
takes a small drink, and grins afterwards. "I'm impressed - I have to
taste it before I can hazard a guess as to the age."</p>
<p>"You'd be surprised what you might find here... they seem to get
everything and anything that other places might take years to find." Mege
shrugs at the second comment, "Thanks... I've been drinking this stuff for
years. I've had the best and the worst of it. You get to know what it is
after I while. I could prolly tell you what it was, just by the color..."</p>
<p>Khirsah 's eyebrow somehow manages to lever itself higher. "I /am/
impressed. I spent the entire time on the Wandering Child - the first ship
I worked on - with a bottle of this stuff around. Ran nearly the entire
range of ages that you can get for under 20,000 credits."</p>
<p>Chuckling, Mege shrugs, "Sounds good. I actually found a bottle of vintage
7BBE in another Tatooinian cantina a few months back... one of the
hand-made bottles. Thing was probably worth over fifty thousand credits
it'self... barkeep didn't know what he had... neither did I, until I
finished it with a good friend of mine. I'm glad I didn't notice,
though... it was farkin' good."</p>
<p>Khirsah grins, and takes another drink of the whiskey. "Aye - it'd be a
shame, really, to let it sit there and just age... I remember a drink of
7BBE I had, a while ago - good stuff. And with more age, well," He shrugs,
"I imagine it got even better."</p>
<p>Vauki nods simply, "Yeah. The older the better... pity they don't make it
like they used too. Bloody kids got addicted to it, not they're making it
too cheaply to be any good."</p>
<p>Khirsah nods and grimaces. "'s the problem, when they get a good drink out
- it becomes popular, everyone wants it, and the quality crashes - pretty
pathetic. If they'd kept it in low production, they'd have earned as much
cash, due t' the price going up."</p>
<p>"I'm almost considerin' switching to Colt 45 pretty soon, if they don't
kick out the newbies. Stuff's been around, just not known enough... not
quite as good, but it's better 'n the new sithspawn they're putting out
nowadays." Vauki sighs, and pulls a drink from the glass slowly, savoring
the liquid.</p>
<p>Khirsah lifts an eyebrow. "Colt 45? Huh - haven't heard of it, even from
Jak, 'n he boasted to've known nearly every kind of drink ever made, and
tasted most of 'em." He takes another drink, letting it sit in his mouth
for a minute before swallowing it. "But I agree - if they don't start
making the stuff proper again, it'll be time to find something else." His
voice's accent has slipped from his usual fairly-precise mode to a
backwater-Caspar mode; not because he's drunk - just looking at him, it's
obvious that he'd likely be able to drink the entire bottle and only be a
bit tipsy - but because he's enjoying the comraderie of another who
appreciates good drinks.</p>
<p>"Yeah... Colt 45. 'Nother acquaintance lost a couple good ol' bottles to
me in a small game of Sabacc a while back. We shared them over a talk at a
bar... it's good stuff... smooth as force itself." Vauki grins, spinning
his glass on the tabletop slowly, leaving a moisture trail behind it. The
dry environment doesn't let the moisture settle for long, as it quickly
evaporates into the arid evening weather. Especially here in Eisley, the
temperatures soar to a searing hundred degrees, even in the night... and
then there's the constant sand, occasional wind, and everything else to
worry about.</p>
<p>Khirsah nods. "Worth lookin' into, then. Whereabout's it made?" He looks
out, looking surprised to see the dense night outside, and looks back at
Mege. "Eh - might be needin' to continue this discussion later - I want to
head out, soon." He considers the bottle on the table. "Seein as how you
paid for it, I'll ask politely - mind if I take a glass with me? Been a
long while since I had a decent drink..."</p>
<p>"It's from Coruscant. Little middle-o-nowhere shack in the Delarius
sector... just ask around if you head there. It's pretty cheap, too...
luckily." He grins, and nods, "Go right ahead. It's been good seein' ya
again. Mayhaps we'll see each other again sometime soon."</p>
<p>Khirsah grins back, and pours a glassfull into a flash he produces from
somewhere on his person. "Much obliged. And 's been good seein' you, too."
His grin turns lopsided. "The way we've been runnin' into each other
lately, I don't doubt we'll meet up again." He scoops the remains of his
forelock off the table, turns, and heads off, pausing briefly at the door
to give that odd half-wave in farewell.</p>
