<td>Born on a small Tatooine mining asteroid, Bazil has never lived the
easy life.&nbsp; Throughout his existance, he has been plagued with problems,
traumatic events, and the chance luck to be able to live through it all.&nbsp;
Twenty-seven years old, Bazil tries to make a living, working in the New
Republic Star Ops, determined to be the best at what he is, and put his
prior life behind him.&nbsp; He has seen the lives of millions of people,
the life of single persons, and a love that was meant to be, all disappear
from beneath his gaze.&nbsp; His last chance awaits him.&nbsp; Hope prevails
over pessimism, a new life being thrust before him.&nbsp; Perhaps, this
time, he will be able to live without so much agony.</td>
