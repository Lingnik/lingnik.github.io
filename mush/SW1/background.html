<p>&nbsp;Bazil Ard'rian McKenzie was born on a small Tatooine Mining Asteroid
settlement, somewhere around twenty-two years before the battle of endor.
His father, Jonah Renae McKenzie, owned the settlement, as well as his
mother, a slave, Alicia Lienne Ard'rian. Bazil and Alicia worked together
in the mines at times, despite his father's best interests in keeping the
two apart. Through the sixteen years he lived there, he saw the worst of
the worst possible conditions, often subjected to horrendous acts by the
non-slaves at the mine. It also subjected him to a large mix of races and
cultures, often seated to eat dinner during the evenings, while a veritable
stew of other creatures practiced their own religious and spiritual beliefs
around him. The practices which surrounded him put him in a very awkward
position: His mother did not practice any such performances, preferring
to keep to herself, and without much interest in the surronding environment.
However, Bazil managed to take on all the religions at once, as a young
boy emulating three or four of the ceremonies all in one sitting. These
practices faltered off later in his life as a slave, leading to more subdued
actions. He soon began to waste away mentally, striving to find the one
beacon of light that might keep him living.
<p>One night, he found that very beacon, finding the opportunity to confront
his father. During routine leaves of absence, his father would often head
down to Tatooine to conduct business dealings with traders. The security
the night had been quite lax, and so Bazil decided to take it upon himself
to get out of there while he could. Stowing in a cargo crate, Bazil managed
to get stuck inside the hold of the small interplanetary shuttle. As the
vehicle took off, he snuck out, taking with him a piece of equipment he
had found lying around inside the crate, and wandered up to the cockpit
cautiously. In an event that would pockmark him for the rest of his life,
haunting him in dreams, and eventually causing him to lose a job at the
news that he had done something as naieve as it, he smashed the metal bar
across his father's head, killing him there on the spot. Unfortunately,
at the time, he wasn't thinking about how he would get the shuttle down
in one piece. His first chance at piloting had ensued, as he tried frantically
to get the shuttle to respond. Finally, he managed to partially figure
it out, and thumped the bucket of metal right down in the middle of the
dune sea.
<p>With little to live off of, save a few credits he stole from his father,
he started his trek across the vast expanse of sand, eventually collapsing
there. After unmeasureable amounts of time, Bazil woke, in a small mud-hut
of a family of two--a husband and wife--who had found the kid, now sixteen,
in the middle of the expanse through some sheer twist of fate. Over several
months, they cared for him, before finally parting to his own ways, headed
towards the downtrodden city of Mos Eisley, where, for three years, he
shuffled around, earning money where he could, and becoming subjected to
conditions only slightly better than what he had endured at the slave mines.
<p>With little to his name, Bazil finally found himself in the services
of a small group of mercenaries, consisting of a single Lambda, and a pair
of old fighters, the still-young man placed in as co-pilot to the shuttle.
Bazil rapidly proved himself to be an able pilot, and eventually replaced
the pilot, of whom died in a small skirmish between some pirates. Then,
Bazil managed to capture the attention of one of the starfighter pilots,
who quickly took him in as a friend, and apprentice. Training him while
the second fighter pilot slept, Bazil quickly rose to understand flight
with ease, each new thing learned quickly absorbed into his rapidly growing
base of knowledge. Eventually, the other fighter pilot was killed, as well,
and due to pressing financial concerns, the young Tatooinian kid was stuck
into the seat permanently. Well, not so permananently, as several months
later the group disbanded, forced to sell the ships.
<p>Without anything more than he had before, save the knowledge of flight,
Bazil set off on a trip that would eventually give birth to a whole new
life. Headed directly towards Caspar, the first place he could name off,
he scoured the streets for jobs, eventually coming into contact with IGNews.
Over the course of mere days, Bazil went from a nobody to a nobody with
a ship, himself now the captain of a small freighter. His job, to boldly
ferry reporters and cargo around for the news company. This job made him
contacts throughout the universe, and finally, a woman friend.
<p>On Caspar, at the age of twenty-four, Bazil met a woman, Casey Johnson:
employee of StarMed, and soldier for hire. His heart finally heard it's
calling, and he fell instantly in love with the woman. Over the course
of several months, the two enjoyed a passing relationship, seeing each
other as the could at various ports of call. Unfortunately, things took
a turn for the worse. Bazil first took some leave with IGNews to head off
to Tatooine, to see what remained of his mother. The news that she had
died several days after he left shocked him at first, but finally, he departed
from past again, and towards Corellia, to meet Casey. The two spent several
days together, and their first real dates, before a strange course of events
took place: She vanished. Heartbroken, the young man tried his hardest
to look for her, scouring the known universe for her, to no avail.
<p>He eventually moved on, deciding to quit IGNews in favor of the Republic,
known only to him as the Rebellion. The choice was made to become a pilot,
and he succeeded. Now, with a mission that would push memories of Casey
out of his mind, Bazil managed to pursue his dream of flight. Quickly rising
through the ranks, he found himself in a new place. His experience prior
had paid off well, as he soon found out. Eventually, another job came along
within the Republic, and Poguala Waaris-Dawntreader, diplomat for the NR.
With little real effort, Bazil finds himself as a pilot, and possibly future-diplomat
for the Republic. Luckily for him, things don't turn out, and he eventually
retires back to his old job of pilot for StarOps, and in a new found position
of XO for Ghost Squadron. Again, he rises through the ranks, leaving him
in a decent position of status, one that most others would take years to
perform. For Bazil McKenzie, it took three years.
